    "informal_statement": "Prove that there exist infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that the largest prime divisor of $n^{4}+n^{2}+1$ is equal to the largest prime divisor of $(n+1)^{4}+(n+1)^{2}+1$.",
    "informal_proof": "Let $p_{n}$ be the largest prime divisor of $n^{4}+n^{2}+1$ and let $q_{n}$ be the largest prime divisor of $n^{2}+n+1$. Then $p_{n}=q_{n^{2}}$, and from\n\n$$\nn^{4}+n^{2}+1=\\left(n^{2}+1\\right)^{2}-n^{2}=\\left(n^{2}-n+1\\right)\\left(n^{2}+n+1\\right)=\\left((n-1)^{2}+(n-1)+1\\right)\\left(n^{2}+n+1\\right)\n$$\n\nit follows that $p_{n}=\\max \\left\\{q_{n}, q_{n-1}\\right\\}$ for $n \\geqslant 2$. Keeping in mind that $n^{2}-n+1$ is odd, we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(n^{2}+n+1, n^{2}-n+1\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(2 n, n^{2}-n+1\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(n, n^{2}-n+1\\right)=1 .\n$$\n\nTherefore $q_{n} \\neq q_{n-1}$.\n\nTo prove the result, it suffices to show that the set\n\n$$\nS=\\left\\{n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 2} \\mid q_{n}>q_{n-1} \\text { and } q_{n}>q_{n+1}\\right\\}\n$$\n\nis infinite, since for each $n \\in S$ one has\n\n$$\np_{n}=\\max \\left\\{q_{n}, q_{n-1}\\right\\}=q_{n}=\\max \\left\\{q_{n}, q_{n+1}\\right\\}=p_{n+1} .\n$$\n\nSuppose on the contrary that $S$ is finite. Since $q_{2}=7<13=q_{3}$ and $q_{3}=13>7=q_{4}$, the set $S$ is non-empty. Since it is finite, we can consider its largest element, say $m$.\n\nNote that it is impossible that $q_{m}>q_{m+1}>q_{m+2}>\\ldots$ because all these numbers are positive integers, so there exists a $k \\geqslant m$ such that $q_{k}<q_{k+1}$ (recall that $q_{k} \\neq q_{k+1}$ ). Next observe that it is impossible to have $q_{k}<q_{k+1}<q_{k+2}<\\ldots$, because $q_{(k+1)^{2}}=p_{k+1}=\\max \\left\\{q_{k}, q_{k+1}\\right\\}=q_{k+1}$, so let us take the smallest $\\ell \\geqslant k+1$ such that $q_{\\ell}>q_{\\ell+1}$. By the minimality of $\\ell$ we have $q_{\\ell-1}<q_{\\ell}$, so $\\ell \\in S$. Since $\\ell \\geqslant k+1>k \\geqslant m$, this contradicts the maximality of $m$, and hence $S$ is indeed infinite."
