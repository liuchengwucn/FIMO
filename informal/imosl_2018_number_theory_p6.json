{"problem_name": "imosl_2018_number_theory_p6", "informal_statement": "Let $f:\\{1,2,3, \\ldots\\} \\rightarrow\\{2,3, \\ldots\\}$ be a function such that $f(m+n) \\mid f(m)+f(n)$ for all pairs $m, n$ of positive integers. Prove that there exists a positive integer $c>1$ which divides all values of $f$.", "informal_proof": "For every positive integer $m$, define $S_{m}=\\{n: m \\mid f(n)\\}$.\n\nLemma. If the set $S_{m}$ is infinite, then $S_{m}=\\{d, 2 d, 3 d, \\ldots\\}=d \\cdot \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ for some positive integer $d$.\n\nProof. Let $d=\\min S_{m}$; the definition of $S_{m}$ yields $m \\mid f(d)$.\n\nWhenever $n \\in S_{m}$ and $n>d$, we have $m|f(n)| f(n-d)+f(d)$, so $m \\mid f(n-d)$ and therefore $n-d \\in S_{m}$. Let $r \\leqslant d$ be the least positive integer with $n \\equiv r(\\bmod d)$; repeating the same step, we can see that $n-d, n-2 d, \\ldots, r \\in S_{m}$. By the minimality of $d$, this shows $r=d$ and therefore $d \\mid n$.\n\nStarting from an arbitrarily large element of $S_{m}$, the process above reaches all multiples of $d$; so they all are elements of $S_{m}$.\n\nThe solution for the problem will be split into two cases.\n\nCase 1: The function $f$ is bounded.\n\nCall a prime $p$ frequent if the set $S_{p}$ is infinite, i.e., if $p$ divides $f(n)$ for infinitely many positive integers $n$; otherwise call $p$ sporadic. Since the function $f$ is bounded, there are only a finite number of primes that divide at least one $f(n)$; so altogether there are finitely many numbers $n$ such that $f(n)$ has a sporadic prime divisor. Let $N$ be a positive integer, greater than all those numbers $n$.\n\nLet $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{k}$ be the frequent primes. By the lemma we have $S_{p_{i}}=d_{i} \\cdot \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ for some $d_{i}$. Consider the number\n\n$$\nn=N d_{1} d_{2} \\cdots d_{k}+1\n$$\n\nDue to $n>N$, all prime divisors of $f(n)$ are frequent primes. Let $p_{i}$ be any frequent prime divisor of $f(n)$. Then $n \\in S_{p_{i}}$, and therefore $d_{i} \\mid n$. But $n \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod d_{i}\\right)$, which means $d_{i}=1$. Hence $S_{p_{i}}=1 \\cdot \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}=\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ and therefore $p_{i}$ is a common divisor of all values $f(n)$.\n\nCase 2: $f$ is unbounded.\n\nWe prove that $f(1)$ divides all $f(n)$.\n\nLet $a=f(1)$. Since $1 \\in S_{a}$, by the lemma it suffices to prove that $S_{a}$ is an infinite set.\n\nCall a positive integer $p$ a peak if $f(p)>\\max (f(1), \\ldots, f(p-1))$. Since $f$ is not bounded, there are infinitely many peaks. Let $1=p_{1}<p_{2}<\\ldots$ be the sequence of all peaks, and let $h_{k}=f\\left(p_{k}\\right)$. Notice that for any peak $p_{i}$ and for any $k<p_{i}$, we have $f\\left(p_{i}\\right) \\mid f(k)+f\\left(p_{i}-k\\right)<$ $2 f\\left(p_{i}\\right)$, hence\n\n$$\nf(k)+f\\left(p_{i}-k\\right)=f\\left(p_{i}\\right)=h_{i}\n$$\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle, among the numbers $h_{1}, h_{2}, \\ldots$ there are infinitely many that are congruent modulo $a$. Let $k_{0}<k_{1}<k_{2}<\\ldots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers such that $h_{k_{0}} \\equiv h_{k_{1}} \\equiv \\ldots(\\bmod a)$. Notice that\n\n$$\nf\\left(p_{k_{i}}-p_{k_{0}}\\right)=f\\left(p_{k_{i}}\\right)-f\\left(p_{k_{0}}\\right)=h_{k_{i}}-h_{k_{0}} \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod a)\n$$\n\nso $p_{k_{i}}-p_{k_{0}} \\in S_{a}$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots$ This provides infinitely many elements in $S_{a}$.\n\nHence, $S_{a}$ is an infinite set, and therefore $f(1)=a$ divides $f(n)$ for every $n$."}
