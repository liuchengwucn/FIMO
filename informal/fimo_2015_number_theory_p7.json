    "informal_statement": "Let $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ denote the set of positive integers. For any positive integer $k$, a function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ is called $k-\\operatorname{good}$ if $\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m) \\leqslant k$ for all $m \\neq n$. Find all $k$ such that there exists a $k$-good function.\n\nThe final answer is $k \\geqslant 2$.",
    "informal_proof": "For any function $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, let $G_{f}(m, n)=\\operatorname{gcd}(f(m)+n, f(n)+m)$. Note that a $k$-good function is also $(k+1)$-good for any positive integer $k$. Hence, it suffices to show that there does not exist a 1-good function and that there exists a 2-good function.\n\nWe first show that there is no 1-good function. Suppose that there exists a function $f$ such that $G_{f}(m, n)=1$ for all $m \\neq n$. Now, if there are two distinct even numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both even, then $2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)$, a contradiction. A similar argument holds if there are two distinct odd numbers $m$ and $n$ such that $f(m)$ and $f(n)$ are both odd. Hence we can choose an even $m$ and an odd $n$ such that $f(m)$ is odd and $f(n)$ is even. This also implies that $2 \\mid G_{f}(m, n)$, a contradiction.\n\nWe now construct a 2-good function. Define $f(n)=2^{g(n)+1}-n-1$, where $g$ is defined recursively by $g(1)=1$ and $g(n+1)=\\left(2^{g(n)+1}\\right) !$.\n\nFor any positive integers $m>n$, set\n\n$$\nA=f(m)+n=2^{g(m)+1}-m+n-1, \\quad B=f(n)+m=2^{g(n)+1}-n+m-1 .\n$$\n\nWe need to show that $\\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) \\leqslant 2$. First, note that $A+B=2^{g(m)+1}+2^{g(n)+1}-2$ is not divisible by 4 , so that $4 \\nmid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)$. Now we suppose that there is an odd prime $p$ for which $p \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(A, B)$ and derive a contradiction.\n\nWe first claim that $2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant B$. This is a rather weak bound; one way to prove it is as follows. Observe that $g(k+1)>g(k)$ and hence $2^{g(k+1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(k)+1}+1$ for every positive integer $k$. By repeatedly applying this inequality, we obtain $2^{g(m-1)+1} \\geqslant 2^{g(n)+1}+(m-1)-n=B$.\n\nNow, since $p \\mid B$, we have $p-1<B \\leqslant 2^{g(m-1)+1}$, so that $p-1 \\mid\\left(2^{g(m-1)+1}\\right)$ ! $=g(m)$. Hence $2^{g(m)} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$, which yields $A+B \\equiv 2^{g(n)+1}(\\bmod p)$. However, since $p \\mid A+B$, this implies that $p=2$, a contradiction."
