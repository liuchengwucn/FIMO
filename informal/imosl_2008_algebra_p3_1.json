{"problem_name": "imosl_2008_algebra_p3_1", "informal_statement": "Let $S \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}$ be a set of real numbers. We say that a pair $(f, g)$ of functions from $S$ into $S$ is a Spanish Couple on $S$, if they satisfy the following conditions:\n\n(i) Both functions are strictly increasing, i.e. $f(x)<f(y)$ and $g(x)<g(y)$ for all $x, y \\in S$ with $x<y$\n\n(ii) The inequality $f(g(g(x)))<g(f(x))$ holds for all $x \\in S$.\n\nDecide whether there exists a Spanish Couple on the set $S=\\mathbb{N}$ of positive integers;\n\nThe final answer is NO.", "informal_proof": "Throughout the solution, we will use the notation $g_{k}(x)=\\overbrace{g(g(\\ldots g}^{k}(x) \\ldots))$, including $g_{0}(x)=x$ as well.\n\nSuppose that there exists a Spanish Couple $(f, g)$ on the set $\\mathbb{N}$. From property (i) we have $f(x) \\geq x$ and $g(x) \\geq x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nWe claim that $g_{k}(x) \\leq f(x)$ for all $k \\geq 0$ and all positive integers $x$. The proof is done by induction on $k$. We already have the base case $k=0$ since $x \\leq f(x)$. For the induction step from $k$ to $k+1$, apply the induction hypothesis on $g_{2}(x)$ instead of $x$, then apply (ii):\n\n$$\ng\\left(g_{k+1}(x)\\right)=g_{k}\\left(g_{2}(x)\\right) \\leq f\\left(g_{2}(x)\\right)<g(f(x)) .\n$$\n\nSince $g$ is increasing, it follows that $g_{k+1}(x)<f(x)$. The claim is proven.\n\nIf $g(x)=x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ then $f(g(g(x)))=f(x)=g(f(x))$, and we have a contradiction with (ii). Therefore one can choose an $x_{0} \\in S$ for which $x_{0}<g\\left(x_{0}\\right)$. Now consider the sequence $x_{0}, x_{1}, \\ldots$ where $x_{k}=g_{k}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$. The sequence is increasing. Indeed, we have $x_{0}<g\\left(x_{0}\\right)=x_{1}$, and $x_{k}<x_{k+1}$ implies $x_{k+1}=g\\left(x_{k}\\right)<g\\left(x_{k+1}\\right)=x_{k+2}$.\n\nHence, we obtain a strictly increasing sequence $x_{0}<x_{1}<\\ldots$ of positive integers which on the other hand has an upper bound, namely $f\\left(x_{0}\\right)$. This cannot happen in the set $\\mathbb{N}$ of positive integers, thus no Spanish Couple exists on $\\mathbb{N}$."}
