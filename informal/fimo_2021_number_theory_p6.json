    "informal_statement": "Determine all integers $n \\geqslant 2$ with the following property: every $n$ pairwise distinct integers whose sum is not divisible by $n$ can be arranged in some order $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ so that $n$ divides $1 \\cdot a_{1}+2 \\cdot a_{2}+\\cdots+n \\cdot a_{n}$.\n\nThe final answers are all odd integers and all powers of 2.",
    "informal_proof": "If $n=2^{k} a$, where $a \\geqslant 3$ is odd and $k$ is a positive integer, we can consider a set containing the number $2^{k}+1$ and $n-1$ numbers congruent to 1 modulo $n$. The sum of these numbers is congruent to $2^{k}$ modulo $n$ and therefore is not divisible by $n$; for any permutation $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ of these numbers\n\n$$\n1 \\cdot a_{1}+2 \\cdot a_{2}+\\cdots+n \\cdot a_{n} \\equiv 1+\\cdots+n \\equiv 2^{k-1} a\\left(2^{k} a+1\\right) \\not \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nand a fortiori $1 \\cdot a_{1}+2 \\cdot a_{2}+\\cdots+n \\cdot a_{n}$ is not divisible by $n$.\n\nFrom now on, we suppose that $n$ is either odd or a power of 2 . Let $S$ be the given set of integers, and $s$ be the sum of elements of $S$.\n\nLemma 1. If there is a permutation $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ of $S$ such that $(n, s)$ divides $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i a_{i}$, then there is a permutation $\\left(b_{i}\\right)$ of $S$ such that $n$ divides $\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i b_{i}$.\n\nProof. Let $r=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i a_{i}$. Consider the permutation $\\left(b_{i}\\right)$ defined by $b_{i}=a_{i+x}$, where $a_{j+n}=a_{j}$. For this permutation, we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i b_{i}=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} i a_{i+x} \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(i-x) a_{i} \\equiv r-s x \\quad(\\bmod n) .\n$$\n\nSince $(n, s)$ divides $r$, the congruence $r-s x \\equiv 0(\\bmod n)$ admits a solution.\n\nLemma 2. Every set $T$ of $k m$ integers, $m>1$, can be partitioned into $m$ sets of $k$ integers so that in every set either the sum of elements is not divisible by $k$ or all the elements leave the same remainder upon division by $k$.\n\nProof. The base case, $m=2$. If $T$ contains $k$ elements leaving the same remainder upon division by $k$, we form one subset $A$ of these elements; the remaining elements form a subset $B$. If $k$ does not divide the sum of all elements of $B$, we are done. Otherwise it is enough to exchange any element of $A$ with any element of $B$ not congruent to it modulo $k$, thus making sums of both $A$ and $B$ not divisible by $k$. This cannot be done only when all the elements of $T$ are congruent modulo $k$; in this case any partition will do.\n\nIf no $k$ elements of $T$ have the same residue modulo $k$, there are three elements $a, b, c \\in T$ leaving pairwise distinct remainders upon division by $k$. Let $t$ be the sum of elements of $T$. It suffices to find $A \\subset T$ such that $|A|=k$ and $\\sum_{x \\in A} x \\not \\equiv 0, t(\\bmod k)$ : then neither the sum of elements of $A$ nor the sum of elements of $B=T \\backslash A$ is divisible by $k$. Consider $U^{\\prime} \\subset T \\backslash\\{a, b, c\\}$ with $\\left|U^{\\prime}\\right|=k-1$. The sums of elements of three sets $U^{\\prime} \\cup\\{a\\}, U^{\\prime} \\cup\\{b\\}, U^{\\prime} \\cup\\{c\\}$ leave three different remainders upon division by $k$, and at least one of them is not congruent either to 0 or to $t$.\n\nNow let $m>2$. If $T$ contains $k$ elements leaving the same remainder upon division by $k$, we form one subset $A$ of these elements and apply the inductive hypothesis to the remaining $k(m-1)$ elements. Otherwise, we choose any $U \\subset T,|U|=k-1$. Since all the remaining elements cannot be congruent modulo $k$, there is $a \\in T \\backslash U$ such that $a \\not \\equiv-\\sum_{x \\in U} x(\\bmod k)$. Now we can take $A=U \\cup\\{a\\}$ and apply the inductive hypothesis to $T \\backslash A$. Now we are ready to prove the statement of the problem for all odd $n$ and $n=2^{k}$. The proof is by induction.\n\nIf $n$ is prime, the statement follows immediately from Lemma 1, since in this case $(n, s)=1$. Turning to the general case, we can find prime $p$ and an integer $t$ such that $p^{t} \\mid n$ and $p^{t} \\nmid s$. By Lemma 2, we can partition $S$ into $p$ sets of $\\frac{n}{p}=k$ elements so that in every set either the sum of numbers is not divisible by $k$ or all numbers have the same residue modulo $k$.\n\nFor sets in the first category, by the inductive hypothesis there is a permutation $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$ such that $k \\mid \\sum_{i=1}^{k} i a_{i}$\n\nIf $n$ (and therefore $k$ ) is odd, then for each permutation $\\left(b_{i}\\right)$ of a set in the second category we have\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k} i b_{i} \\equiv b_{1} \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod k)\n$$\n\nBy combining such permutation for all sets of the partition, we get a permutation $\\left(c_{i}\\right)$ of $S$ such that $k \\mid \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i c_{i}$. Since this sum is divisible by $k$, and $k$ is divisible by $(n, s)$, we are done by Lemma 1 .\n\nIf $n=2^{s}$, we have $p=2$ and $k=2^{s-1}$. Then for each of the subsets there is a permutation $\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k}\\right)$ such that $\\sum_{i=1}^{k} i a_{i}$ is divisible by $2^{s-2}=\\frac{k}{2}$ : if the subset belongs to the first category, the expression is divisible even by $k$, and if it belongs to the second one,\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k} i a_{i} \\equiv a_{1} \\frac{k(k+1)}{2} \\equiv 0\\left(\\bmod \\frac{k}{2}\\right) \\text {. }\n$$\n\nNow the numbers of each permutation should be multiplied by all the odd or all the even numbers not exceeding $n$ in increasing order so that the resulting sums are divisible by $k$ :\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{k}(2 i-1) a_{i} \\equiv \\sum_{i=1}^{k} 2 i a_{i} \\equiv 2 \\sum_{i=1}^{k} i a_{i} \\equiv 0 \\quad(\\bmod k) .\n$$\n\nCombining these two sums, we again get a permutation $\\left(c_{i}\\right)$ of $S$ such that $k \\mid \\sum_{i=1}^{n} i c_{i}$, and finish the case by applying Lemma 1."
