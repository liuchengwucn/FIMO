    "informal_proof": "We call a set $\\mathcal{S}$ of positive integers good if no its element is a sum of two other distinct members of $\\mathcal{S}$. We will use the following simple observation.\n\nObservation A. If $a, b$, and $c$ are three distinct elements of a good set $\\mathcal{S}$ with $b>a, c$, then $b \\nmid a+c$. Otherwise, since $b \\neq a+c$, we would have $b \\leqslant(a+c) / 2<\\max \\{a, c\\}$.\n\nWe prove the following stronger statement.\n\nClaim. Let $\\mathcal{S}$ be a good set consisting of $n \\geqslant 2$ positive integers. Then the elements of $\\mathcal{S}$ may be ordered as $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ so that $a_{i} \\nmid a_{i-1}+a_{i+1}$ and $a_{i} \\nmid a_{i-1}-a_{i+1}$, for all $i=2,3, \\ldots, n-1$.\n\nProof. Say that the ordering $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ of $\\mathcal{S}$ is nice if it satisfies the required property.\n\nWe proceed by induction on $n$. The base case $n=2$ is trivial, as there are no restrictions on the ordering.\n\nTo perform the step of induction, suppose that $n \\geqslant 3$. Let $a=\\max \\mathcal{S}$, and set $\\mathcal{T}=\\mathcal{S} \\backslash\\{a\\}$. Use the inductive hypothesis to find a nice ordering $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n-1}$ of $\\mathcal{T}$. We will show that a may be inserted into this sequence so as to reach a nice ordering of $\\mathcal{S}$. In other words, we will show that there exists a $j \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the ordering\n\n$$\nN_{j}=\\left(b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{j-1}, a, b_{j}, b_{j+1}, \\ldots, b_{n-1}\\right)\n$$\n\nis nice.\n\nAssume that, for some $j$, the ordering $N_{j}$ is not nice, so that some element $x$ in it divides either the sum or the difference of two adjacent ones. This did not happen in the ordering of $\\mathcal{T}$, hence $x \\in\\left\\{b_{j-1}, a, b_{j}\\right\\}$ (if, say, $b_{j-1}$ does not exist, then $x \\in\\left\\{a, b_{j}\\right\\}$; a similar agreement is applied hereafter). But the case $x=a$ is impossible: $a$ cannot divide $b_{j-1}-b_{j}$, since $0<\\left|b_{j-1}-b_{j}\\right|<a$, while $a \\nmid b_{j-1}+b_{j}$ by Observation A. Therefore $x \\in\\left\\{b_{j-1}, b_{j}\\right\\}$. In this case, assign the number $x$ to the index $j$.\n\nSuppose now that none of the $N_{j}$ is nice. Since there are $n$ possible indices $j$, and only $n-1$ elements in $\\mathcal{T}$, one of those elements $\\left(\\right.$ say, $\\left.b_{k}\\right)$ is assigned to two different indices, which then should equal $k$ and $k+1$. This means that $b_{k}$ divides the numbers $b_{k-1}+\\varepsilon_{1} a$ and $a+\\varepsilon_{2} b_{k+1}$, for some signs $\\varepsilon_{1}, \\varepsilon_{2} \\in\\{-1,1\\}$. But then\n\n$$\nb_{k-1} \\equiv-\\varepsilon_{1} a \\equiv \\varepsilon_{1} \\varepsilon_{2} b_{k+1} \\quad\\left(\\bmod b_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nand therefore $b_{k} \\mid b_{k-1}-\\varepsilon_{1} \\varepsilon_{2} b_{k+1}$, which means that the ordering of $\\mathcal{T}$ was not nice. This contradiction proves the step of induction."
