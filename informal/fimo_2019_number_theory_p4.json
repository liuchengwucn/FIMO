    "informal_statement": "Let $\\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ be the set of positive integers. A positive integer constant $C$ is given. Find all functions $f: \\mathbb{Z}_{>0} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ such that, for all positive integers $a$ and $b$ satisfying $a+b>C$,\n\n$$\na+f(b) \\mid a^{2}+b f(a)\n$$\n\nThe final answers are exactly the functions $f(a)=k a$ for some constant $k \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ (irrespective of the value of $C$ ).",
    "informal_proof": "It is easy to verify that the functions $f(a)=k a$ satisfy $(*)$. Thus, in the proofs below, we will only focus on the converse implication: that condition $(*)$ implies that $f=k a$.\n\nA common minor part of these solutions is the derivation of some relatively easy bounds on the function $f$. An upper bound is easily obtained by setting $a=1$ in (*), giving the inequality\n\n$$\nf(b) \\leqslant b \\cdot f(1)\n$$\n\nfor all sufficiently large $b$. The corresponding lower bound is only marginally more difficult to obtain: substituting $b=1$ in the original equation shows that\n\n$$\na+f(1) \\mid\\left(a^{2}+f(a)\\right)-(a-f(1)) \\cdot(a+f(1))=f(1)^{2}+f(a)\n$$\n\nfor all sufficiently large $a$. It follows from this that one has the lower bound\n\n$$\nf(a) \\geqslant a+f(1) \\cdot(1-f(1))\n$$\n\nagain for all sufficiently large $a$.\n\nEach of the following proofs makes use of at least one of these bounds.\n\nFirst, we show that $b \\mid f(b)^{2}$ for all $b$. To do this, we choose a large positive integer $n$ so that $n b-f(b) \\geqslant C$. Setting $a=n b-f(b)$ in $(*)$ then shows that\n\n$$\nn b \\mid(n b-f(b))^{2}+b f(n b-f(b))\n$$\n\nso that $b \\mid f(b)^{2}$ as claimed.\n\nNow in particular we have that $p \\mid f(p)$ for every prime $p$. If we write $f(p)=k(p) \\cdot p$, then the bound $f(p) \\leqslant f(1) \\cdot p$ (valid for $p$ sufficiently large) shows that some value $k$ of $k(p)$ must be attained for infinitely many $p$. We will show that $f(a)=k a$ for all positive integers $a$. To do this, we substitute $b=p$ in $(*)$, where $p$ is any sufficiently large prime for which $k(p)=k$, obtaining\n\n$$\na+k p \\mid\\left(a^{2}+p f(a)\\right)-a(a+k p)=p f(a)-p k a .\n$$\n\nFor suitably large $p$ we have $\\operatorname{gcd}(a+k p, p)=1$, and hence we have\n\n$$\na+k p \\mid f(a)-k a\n$$\n\nBut the only way this can hold for arbitrarily large $p$ is if $f(a)-k a=0$. This concludes the proof."
