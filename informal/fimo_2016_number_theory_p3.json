Determine the smallest size of a fragrant set.\n\nThe final answer is 6 .",
    "informal_proof": "We have the following observations.\n\n(i) $(P(n), P(n+1))=1$ for any $n$.\n\nWe have $(P(n), P(n+1))=\\left(n^{2}+n+1, n^{2}+3 n+3\\right)=\\left(n^{2}+n+1,2 n+2\\right)$. Noting that $n^{2}+n+1$ is odd and $\\left(n^{2}+n+1, n+1\\right)=(1, n+1)=1$, the claim follows.\n\n(ii) $(P(n), P(n+2))=1$ for $n \\not \\equiv 2(\\bmod 7)$ and $(P(n), P(n+2))=7$ for $n \\equiv 2(\\bmod 7)$.\n\nFrom $(2 n+7) P(n)-(2 n-1) P(n+2)=14$ and the fact that $P(n)$ is odd, $(P(n), P(n+2))$ must be a divisor of 7 . The claim follows by checking $n \\equiv 0,1, \\ldots, 6(\\bmod 7)$ directly.\n\n(iii) $(P(n), P(n+3))=1$ for $n \\not \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)$ and $3 \\mid(P(n), P(n+3))$ for $n \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)$.\n\nFrom $(n+5) P(n)-(n-1) P(n+3)=18$ and the fact that $P(n)$ is odd, $(P(n), P(n+3))$ must be a divisor of 9 . The claim follows by checking $n \\equiv 0,1,2(\\bmod 3)$ directly.\n\nSuppose there exists a fragrant set with at most 5 elements. We may assume it contains exactly 5 elements $P(a), P(a+1), \\ldots, P(a+4)$ since the following argument also works with fewer elements. Consider $P(a+2)$. From (i), it is relatively prime to $P(a+1)$ and $P(a+3)$. Without loss of generality, assume $(P(a), P(a+2))>1$. From (ii), we have $a \\equiv 2(\\bmod 7)$. The same observation implies $(P(a+1), P(a+3))=1$. In order that the set is fragrant, $(P(a), P(a+3))$ and $(P(a+1), P(a+4))$ must both be greater than 1. From (iii), this holds only when both $a$ and $a+1$ are congruent to $1 \\bmod 3$, which is a contradiction.\n\nIt now suffices to construct a fragrant set of size 6. By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we can take a positive integer $a$ such that\n\n$$\na \\equiv 7 \\quad(\\bmod 19), \\quad a+1 \\equiv 2 \\quad(\\bmod 7), \\quad a+2 \\equiv 1 \\quad(\\bmod 3) .\n$$\n\nFor example, we may take $a=197$. From (ii), both $P(a+1)$ and $P(a+3)$ are divisible by 7. From (iii), both $P(a+2)$ and $P(a+5)$ are divisible by 3 . One also checks from 19|P(7) $=57$ and $19 \\mid P(11)=133$ that $P(a)$ and $P(a+4)$ are divisible by 19 . Therefore, the set $\\{P(a), P(a+1), \\ldots, P(a+5)\\}$ is fragrant.\n\nTherefore, the smallest size of a fragrant set is 6 ."
