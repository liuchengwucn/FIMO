    "informal_statement": "Prove that there are only finitely many quadruples $(a, b, c, n)$ of positive integers such that\n\n$$\nn !=a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}+c^{n-1}\n$$",
    "informal_proof": "For fixed $n$ there are clearly finitely many solutions; we will show that there is no solution with $n>100$. So, assume $n>100$. By the AM-GM inequality,\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nn ! & =2 n(n-1)(n-2)(n-3) \\cdot(3 \\cdot 4 \\cdots(n-4)) \\\\\n& \\leqslant 2(n-1)^{4}\\left(\\frac{3+\\cdots+(n-4)}{n-6}\\right)^{n-6}=2(n-1)^{4}\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)^{n-6}<\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)^{n-1}\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nthus $a, b, c<(n-1) / 2$.\n\nFor every prime $p$ and integer $m \\neq 0$, let $\\nu_{p}(m)$ denote the $p$-adic valuation of $m$; that is, the greatest non-negative integer $k$ for which $p^{k}$ divides $m$. Legendre's formula states that\n\n$$\n\\nu_{p}(n !)=\\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty}\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{p^{s}}\\right\\rfloor\n$$\n\nand a well-know corollary of this formula is that\n\n$$\n\\nu_{p}(n !)<\\sum_{s=1}^{\\infty} \\frac{n}{p^{s}}=\\frac{n}{p-1}\n$$\n\nIf $n$ is odd then $a^{n-1}, b^{n-1}, c^{n-1}$ are squares, and by considering them modulo 4 we conclude that $a, b$ and $c$ must be even. Hence, $2^{n-1} \\mid n$ ! but that is impossible for odd $n$ because $\\nu_{2}(n !)=\\nu_{2}((n-1) !)<n-1$ by $(\\nabla)$\n\nFrom now on we assume that $n$ is even. If all three numbers $a+b, b+c, c+a$ are powers of 2 then $a, b, c$ have the same parity. If they all are odd, then $n !=a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}+c^{n-1}$ is also odd which is absurd. If all $a, b, c$ are divisible by 4 , this contradicts $\\nu_{2}(n !) \\leqslant n-1$. If, say, $a$ is not divisible by 4 , then $2 a=(a+b)+(a+c)-(b+c)$ is not divisible by 8 , and since all $a+b, b+c$, $c+a$ are powers of 2 , we get that one of these sums equals 4 , so two of the numbers of $a, b, c$ are equal to 2. Say, $a=b=2$, then $c=2^{r}-2$ and, since $c \\mid n$ !, we must have $c \\mid a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}=2^{n}$ implying $r=2$, and so $c=2$, which is impossible because $n ! \\equiv 0 \\not \\equiv 3 \\cdot 2^{n-1}(\\bmod 5)$.\n\nSo now we assume that the sum of two numbers among $a, b, c$, say $a+b$, is not a power of 2 , so it is divisible by some odd prime $p$. Then $p \\leqslant a+b<n$ and so $c^{n-1}=n !-\\left(a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}\\right)$ is divisible by $p$. If $p$ divides $a$ and $b$, we get $p^{n-1} \\mid n$ !, contradicting $(\\odot)$. Next, using ( $\\left.\\nabla\\right)$ and the Lifting the Exponent Lemma we get\n\n$$\n\\nu_{p}(1)+\\nu_{p}(2)+\\cdots+\\nu_{p}(n)=\\nu_{p}(n !)=\\nu_{p}\\left(n !-c^{n-1}\\right)=\\nu_{p}\\left(a^{n-1}+b^{n-1}\\right)=\\nu_{p}(a+b)+\\nu_{p}(n-1) .(\\diamond)\n$$\n\nIn view of $(\\diamond)$, no number of $1,2, \\ldots, n$ can be divisible by $p$, except $a+b$ and $n-1>a+b$. On the other hand, $p \\mid c$ implies that $p<n / 2$ and so there must be at least two such numbers. Hence, there are two multiples of $p$ among $1,2, \\ldots, n$, namely $a+b=p$ and $n-1=2 p$. But this is another contradiction because $n-1$ is odd. This final contradiction shows that there is no solution of the equation for $n>100$."
