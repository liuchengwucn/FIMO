    "informal_statement": "Let $\\mathbb{N}$ be the set of all positive integers. Find all functions $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ such that the number $(f(m)+n)(m+f(n))$ is a square for all $m, n \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n\nThe final answers are all functions of the form $f(n)=n+c$, where $c \\in \\mathbb{N} \\cup\\{0\\}$.",
    "informal_proof": "First, it is clear that all functions of the form $f(n)=n+c$ with a constant nonnegative integer $c$ satisfy the problem conditions since $(f(m)+n)(f(n)+m)=(n+m+c)^{2}$ is a square.\n\nWe are left to prove that there are no other functions. We start with the following Lemma. Suppose that $p \\mid f(k)-f(\\ell)$ for some prime $p$ and positive integers $k, \\ell$. Then $p \\mid k-\\ell$. Proof. Suppose first that $p^{2} \\mid f(k)-f(\\ell)$, so $f(\\ell)=f(k)+p^{2} a$ for some integer $a$. Take some positive integer $D>\\max \\{f(k), f(\\ell)\\}$ which is not divisible by $p$ and set $n=p D-f(k)$. Then the positive numbers $n+f(k)=p D$ and $n+f(\\ell)=p D+(f(\\ell)-f(k))=p(D+p a)$ are both divisible by $p$ but not by $p^{2}$. Now, applying the problem conditions, we get that both the numbers $(f(k)+n)(f(n)+k)$ and $(f(\\ell)+n)(f(n)+\\ell)$ are squares divisible by $p$ (and thus by $\\left.p^{2}\\right)$; this means that the multipliers $f(n)+k$ and $f(n)+\\ell$ are also divisible by $p$, therefore $p \\mid(f(n)+k)-(f(n)+\\ell)=k-\\ell$ as well.\n\nOn the other hand, if $f(k)-f(\\ell)$ is divisible by $p$ but not by $p^{2}$, then choose the same number $D$ and set $n=p^{3} D-f(k)$. Then the positive numbers $f(k)+n=p^{3} D$ and $f(\\ell)+n=$ $p^{3} D+(f(\\ell)-f(k))$ are respectively divisible by $p^{3}$ (but not by $\\left.p^{4}\\right)$ and by $p$ (but not by $p^{2}$ ). Hence in analogous way we obtain that the numbers $f(n)+k$ and $f(n)+\\ell$ are divisible by $p$, therefore $p \\mid(f(n)+k)-(f(n)+\\ell)=k-\\ell$.\n\nWe turn to the problem. First, suppose that $f(k)=f(\\ell)$ for some $k, \\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Then by Lemma we have that $k-\\ell$ is divisible by every prime number, so $k-\\ell=0$, or $k=\\ell$. Therefore, the function $f$ is injective.\n\nNext, consider the numbers $f(k)$ and $f(k+1)$. Since the number $(k+1)-k=1$ has no prime divisors, by Lemma the same holds for $f(k+1)-f(k)$; thus $|f(k+1)-f(k)|=1$.\n\nNow, let $f(2)-f(1)=q,|q|=1$. Then we prove by induction that $f(n)=f(1)+q(n-1)$. The base for $n=1,2$ holds by the definition of $q$. For the step, if $n>1$ we have $f(n+1)=$ $f(n) \\pm q=f(1)+q(n-1) \\pm q$. Since $f(n) \\neq f(n-2)=f(1)+q(n-2)$, we get $f(n)=f(1)+q n$, as desired.\n\nFinally, we have $f(n)=f(1)+q(n-1)$. Then $q$ cannot be $-1$ since otherwise for $n \\geq f(1)+1$ we have $f(n) \\leq 0$ which is impossible. Hence $q=1$ and $f(n)=(f(1)-1)+n$ for each $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$, and $f(1)-1 \\geq 0$, as desired."
