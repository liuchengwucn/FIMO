    "informal_statement": "For $x \\in(0,1)$ let $y \\in(0,1)$ be the number whose $n$th digit after the decimal point is the $\\left(2^{n}\\right)$ th digit after the decimal point of $x$. Show that if $x$ is rational then so is $y$.\n",
    "informal_proof": "Since $x$ is rational, its digits repeat periodically starting at some point. We wish to show that this is also true for the digits of $y$, implying that $y$ is rational.\n\nLet $d$ be the length of the period of $x$ and let $d=2^{u} \\cdot v$, where $v$ is odd. There is a positive integer $w$ such that\n\n$$\n2^{w} \\equiv 1 \\quad(\\bmod v) .\n$$\n\n(For instance, one can choose $w$ to be $\\varphi(v)$, the value of Euler's function at $v$.) Therefore\n\n$$\n2^{n+w}=2^{n} \\cdot 2^{w} \\equiv 2^{n} \\quad(\\bmod v)\n$$\n\nfor each $n$. Also, for $n \\geq u$ we have\n\n$$\n2^{n+w} \\equiv 2^{n} \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{u}\\right) .\n$$\n\nIt follows that, for all $n \\geq u$, the relation\n\n$$\n2^{n+w} \\equiv 2^{n} \\quad(\\bmod d)\n$$\n\nholds. Thus, for $n$ sufficiently large, the $2^{n+w}$ th digit of $x$ is in the same spot in the cycle of $x$ as its $2^{n}$ th digit, and so these digits are equal. Hence the $(n+w)$ th digit of $y$ is equal to its $n$th digit. This means that the digits of $y$ repeat periodically with period $w$ from some point on, as required."
