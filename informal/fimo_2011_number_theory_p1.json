    "informal_statement": "For any integer $d>0$, let $f(d)$ be the smallest positive integer that has exactly $d$ positive divisors (so for example we have $f(1)=1, f(5)=16$, and $f(6)=12$ ). Prove that for every integer $k \\geq 0$ the number $f\\left(2^{k}\\right)$ divides $f\\left(2^{k+1}\\right)$.",
    "informal_proof": "For any positive integer $n$, let $d(n)$ be the number of positive divisors of $n$. Let $n=\\prod_{p} p^{a(p)}$ be the prime factorization of $n$ where $p$ ranges over the prime numbers, the integers $a(p)$ are nonnegative and all but finitely many $a(p)$ are zero. Then we have $d(n)=\\prod_{p}(a(p)+1)$. Thus, $d(n)$ is a power of 2 if and only if for every prime $p$ there is a nonnegative integer $b(p)$ with $a(p)=2^{b(p)}-1=1+2+2^{2}+\\cdots+2^{b(p)-1}$. We then have\n\n$$\nn=\\prod_{p} \\prod_{i=0}^{b(p)-1} p^{2^{i}}, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad d(n)=2^{k} \\quad \\text { with } \\quad k=\\sum_{p} b(p) .\n$$\n\nLet $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all numbers of the form $p^{2^{r}}$ with $p$ prime and $r$ a nonnegative integer. Then we deduce that $d(n)$ is a power of 2 if and only if $n$ is the product of the elements of some finite subset $\\mathcal{T}$ of $\\mathcal{S}$ that satisfies the following condition: for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$ and $s \\in \\mathcal{S}$ with $s \\mid t$ we have $s \\in \\mathcal{T}$. Moreover, if $d(n)=2^{k}$ then the corresponding set $\\mathcal{T}$ has $k$ elements.\n\nNote that the set $\\mathcal{T}_{k}$ consisting of the smallest $k$ elements from $\\mathcal{S}$ obviously satisfies the condition above. Thus, given $k$, the smallest $n$ with $d(n)=2^{k}$ is the product of the elements of $\\mathcal{T}_{k}$. This $n$ is $f\\left(2^{k}\\right)$. Since obviously $\\mathcal{T}_{k} \\subset \\mathcal{T}_{k+1}$, it follows that $f\\left(2^{k}\\right) \\mid f\\left(2^{k+1}\\right)$."
