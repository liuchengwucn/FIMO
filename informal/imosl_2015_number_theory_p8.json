It remains to show the converse.\n\nAssume that $f$ is a function satisfying the problem condition. Notice that the function $g(x)=f(x)-f(0)$ also satisfies this condition. Replacing $f$ by $g$, we assume from now on that $f(0)=0$; then $f(n)>0$ for any positive integer $n$. Thus, we aim to prove that there exists a positive integer $a$ with $\\mho(a)=0$ such that $f(n)=a$ for all $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nWe start by introducing some notation. Set $N=10^{100}$. We say that a prime $p$ is large if $p>N$, and $p$ is small otherwise; let $\\mathcal{S}$ be the set of all small primes. Next, we say that a positive integer is large or small if all its prime factors are such (thus, the number 1 is the unique number which is both large and small). For a positive integer $k$, we denote the greatest large divisor of $k$ and the greatest small divisor of $k$ by $L(k)$ and $S(k)$, respectively; thus, $k=L(k) S(k)$\n\nWe split the proof into three steps.\n\nStep 1. We prove that for every large $k$, we have $k|f(a)-f(b) \\Longleftrightarrow k| a-b$. In other words, $L(f(a)-f(b))=L(a-b)$ for all integers $a$ and $b$ with $a>b$.\n\nWe use induction on $k$. The base case $k=1$ is trivial. For the induction step, assume that $k_{0}$ is a large number, and that the statement holds for all large numbers $k$ with $k<k_{0}$.\n\nClaim 1. For any integers $x$ and $y$ with $0<x-y<k_{0}$, the number $k_{0}$ does not divide $f(x)-f(y)$\n\nProof. Assume, to the contrary, that $k_{0} \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Let $\\ell=L(x-y)$; then $\\ell \\leqslant x-y<k_{0}$. By the induction hypothesis, $\\ell \\mid f(x)-f(y)$, and thus $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\mid f(x)-f(y)$. Notice that $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)$ is large, and $\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right) \\geqslant k_{0}>\\ell$. But then\n\n$$\n\\mho(f(x)-f(y)) \\geqslant \\mho\\left(\\operatorname{lcm}\\left(k_{0}, \\ell\\right)\\right)>\\mho(\\ell)=\\mho(x-y)\n$$\n\nwhich is impossible.\n\nNow we complete the induction step. By Claim 1, for every integer $a$ each of the sequences\n\n$$\nf(a), f(a+1), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}-1\\right) \\text { and } f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\n$$\n\nforms a complete residue system modulo $k_{0}$. This yields $f(a) \\equiv f\\left(a+k_{0}\\right)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. Thus, $f(a) \\equiv f(b)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ whenever $a \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$.\n\nFinally, if $a \\neq \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ then there exists an integer $b^{\\prime}$ such that $b^{\\prime} \\equiv b\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$ and $\\left|a-b^{\\prime}\\right|<k_{0}$. Then $f(b) \\equiv f\\left(b^{\\prime}\\right) \\not \\equiv f(a)\\left(\\bmod k_{0}\\right)$. The induction step is proved.\n\nStep 2. We prove that for some small integer a there exist infinitely many integers $n$ such that $\\overline{f(n)}=$ an. In other words, $f$ is linear on some infinite set.\n\nWe start with the following general statement. Claim 2. There exists a constant $c$ such that $f(t)<c t$ for every positive integer $t>N$.\n\nProof. Let $d$ be the product of all small primes, and let $\\alpha$ be a positive integer such that $2^{\\alpha}>f(N)$. Then, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ the numbers $f(0), f(1), \\ldots, f(N)$ are distinct modulo $p^{\\alpha}$. Set $P=d^{\\alpha}$ and $c=P+f(N)$.\n\nChoose any integer $t>N$. Due to the choice of $\\alpha$, for every $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$ there exists at most one nonnegative integer $i \\leqslant N$ with $p^{\\alpha} \\mid f(t)-f(i)$. Since $|\\mathcal{S}|<N$, we can choose a nonnegative integer $j \\leqslant N$ such that $p^{\\alpha} \\nmid f(t)-f(j)$ for all $p \\in \\mathcal{S}$. Therefore, $S(f(t)-f(j))<P$.\n\nOn the other hand, Step 1 shows that $L(f(t)-f(j))=L(t-j) \\leqslant t-j$. Since $0 \\leqslant j \\leqslant N$, this yields\n\n$$\nf(t)=f(j)+L(f(t)-f(j)) \\cdot S(f(t)-f(j))<f(N)+(t-j) P \\leqslant(P+f(N)) t=c t .\n$$\n\nNow let $\\mathcal{T}$ be the set of large primes. For every $t \\in \\mathcal{T}$, Step 1 implies $L(f(t))=t$, so the ratio $f(t) / t$ is an integer. Now Claim 2 leaves us with only finitely many choices for this ratio, which means that there exists an infinite subset $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime} \\subseteq \\mathcal{T}$ and a positive integer a such that $f(t)=$ at for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, as required.\n\nSince $L(t)=L(f(t))=L(a) L(t)$ for all $t \\in \\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$, we get $L(a)=1$, so the number $a$ is small.\n\nStep 3. We show that $f(x)=$ ax for all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nLet $R_{i}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: x \\equiv i(\\bmod N !)\\}$ denote the residue class of $i$ modulo $N !$.\n\nClaim 3. Assume that for some $r$, there are infinitely many $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a n$. Then $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{r+1}$.\n\nProof. Choose any $x \\in R_{r+1}$. By our assumption, we can select $n \\in R_{r}$ such that $f(n)=a$ an and $|n-x|>|f(x)-a x|$. Since $n-x \\equiv r-(r+1)=-1(\\bmod N !)$, the number $|n-x|$ is large. Therefore, by Step 1 we have $f(x) \\equiv f(n)=a n \\equiv a x(\\bmod n-x)$, so $n-x \\mid f(x)-a x$. Due to the choice of $n$, this yields $f(x)=a x$.\n\nTo complete Step 3, notice that the set $\\mathcal{T}^{\\prime}$ found in Step 2 contains infinitely many elements of some residue class $R_{i}$. Applying Claim 3, we successively obtain that $f(x)=a x$ for all $x \\in R_{i+1}, R_{i+2}, \\ldots, R_{i+N !}=R_{i}$. This finishes the solution."}
