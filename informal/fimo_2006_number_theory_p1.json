    "informal_statement": "Determine all pairs $(x, y)$ of integers satisfying the equation\n\n$$\n1+2^{x}+2^{2 x+1}=y^{2} .\n$$\n\nThe final answers are $(x, y):(0,2),(0,-2),(4,23),(4,-23)$.",
    "informal_proof": "If $(x, y)$ is a solution then obviously $x \\geq 0$ and $(x,-y)$ is a solution too. For $x=0$ we get the two solutions $(0,2)$ and $(0,-2)$.\n\nNow let $(x, y)$ be a solution with $x>0$; without loss of generality confine attention to $y>0$. The equation rewritten as\n\n$$\n2^{x}\\left(1+2^{x+1}\\right)=(y-1)(y+1)\n$$\n\nshows that the factors $y-1$ and $y+1$ are even, exactly one of them divisible by 4 . Hence $x \\geq 3$ and one of these factors is divisible by $2^{x-1}$ but not by $2^{x}$. So\n\n$$\ny=2^{x-1} m+\\epsilon, \\quad m \\text { odd }, \\quad \\epsilon=\\pm 1 .\n$$\n\nPlugging this into the original equation we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{x}\\left(1+2^{x+1}\\right)=\\left(2^{x-1} m+\\epsilon\\right)^{2}-1=2^{2 x-2} m^{2}+2^{x} m \\epsilon\n$$\n\nor, equivalently\n\n$$\n1+2^{x+1}=2^{x-2} m^{2}+m \\epsilon\n$$\n\nTherefore\n\n$$\n1-\\epsilon m=2^{x-2}\\left(m^{2}-8\\right) .\n$$\n\nFor $\\epsilon=1$ this yields $m^{2}-8 \\leq 0$, i.e., $m=1$, which fails to satisfy (2).\n\nFor $\\epsilon=-1$ equation (2) gives us\n\n$$\n1+m=2^{x-2}\\left(m^{2}-8\\right) \\geq 2\\left(m^{2}-8\\right)\n$$\n\nimplying $2 m^{2}-m-17 \\leq 0$. Hence $m \\leq 3$; on the other hand $m$ cannot be 1 by (2). Because $m$ is odd, we obtain $m=3$, leading to $x=4$. From (1) we get $y=23$. These values indeed satisfy the given equation. Recall that then $y=-23$ is also good. Thus we have the complete list of solutions $(x, y):(0,2),(0,-2),(4,23),(4,-23)$."
