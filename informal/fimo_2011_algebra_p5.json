    "informal_statement": "Prove that for every positive integer $n$, the set $\\{2,3,4, \\ldots, 3 n+1\\}$ can be partitioned into $n$ triples in such a way that the numbers from each triple are the lengths of the sides of some obtuse triangle.",
    "informal_proof": "Throughout the solution, we denote by $[a, b]$ the set $\\{a, a+1, \\ldots, b\\}$. We say that $\\{a, b, c\\}$ is an obtuse triple if $a, b, c$ are the sides of some obtuse triangle.\n\nWe prove by induction on $n$ that there exists a partition of $[2,3 n+1]$ into $n$ obtuse triples $A_{i}$ $(2 \\leq i \\leq n+1)$ having the form $A_{i}=\\left\\{i, a_{i}, b_{i}\\right\\}$. For the base case $n=1$, one can simply set $A_{2}=\\{2,3,4\\}$. For the induction step, we need the following simple lemma.\n\nLemma. Suppose that the numbers $a<b<c$ form an obtuse triple, and let $x$ be any positive number. Then the triple $\\{a, b+x, c+x\\}$ is also obtuse.\n\nProof. The numbers $a<b+x<c+x$ are the sides of a triangle because $(c+x)-(b+x)=$ $c-b<a$. This triangle is obtuse since $(c+x)^{2}-(b+x)^{2}=(c-b)(c+b+2 x)>(c-b)(c+b)>a^{2}$.\n\nNow we turn to the induction step. Let $n>1$ and put $t=\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor<n$. By the induction hypothesis, there exists a partition of the set $[2,3 t+1]$ into $t$ obtuse triples $A_{i}^{\\prime}=\\left\\{i, a_{i}^{\\prime}, b_{i}^{\\prime}\\right\\}$ $(i \\in[2, t+1])$. For the same values of $i$, define $A_{i}=\\left\\{i, a_{i}^{\\prime}+(n-t), b_{i}^{\\prime}+(n-t)\\right\\}$. The constructed triples are obviously disjoint, and they are obtuse by the lemma. Moreover, we have\n\n$$\n\\bigcup_{i=2}^{t+1} A_{i}=[2, t+1] \\cup[n+2, n+2 t+1] .\n$$\n\nNext, for each $i \\in[t+2, n+1]$, define $A_{i}=\\{i, n+t+i, 2 n+i\\}$. All these sets are disjoint, and\n\n$$\n\\bigcup_{i=t+2}^{n+1} A_{i}=[t+2, n+1] \\cup[n+2 t+2,2 n+t+1] \\cup[2 n+t+2,3 n+1]\n$$\n\nso\n\n$$\n\\bigcup_{i=2}^{n+1} A_{i}=[2,3 n+1] .\n$$\n\nThus, we are left to prove that the triple $A_{i}$ is obtuse for each $i \\in[t+2, n+1]$.\n\nSince $(2 n+i)-(n+t+i)=n-t<t+2 \\leq i$, the elements of $A_{i}$ are the sides of a triangle. Next, we have\n\n$(2 n+i)^{2}-(n+t+i)^{2}=(n-t)(3 n+t+2 i) \\geq \\frac{n}{2} \\cdot(3 n+3(t+1)+1)>\\frac{n}{2} \\cdot \\frac{9 n}{2} \\geq(n+1)^{2} \\geq i^{2}$, so this triangle is obtuse. The proof is completed."
