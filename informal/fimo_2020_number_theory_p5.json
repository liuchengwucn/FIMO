    "informal_statement": "Determine all functions $f$ defined on the set of all positive integers and taking non-negative integer values, satisfying the three conditions:\n\n(i) $f(n) \\neq 0$ for at least one $n$;\n\n(ii) $f(x y)=f(x)+f(y)$ for every positive integers $x$ and $y$;\n\n(iii) there are infinitely many positive integers $n$ such that $f(k)=f(n-k)$ for all $k<n$.\n\nThe final answer is that the sought functions are those of the form $f(n)=c \\cdot \\nu_{p}(n)$, where $p$ is some prime, $c$ is a nonnegative integer, and $\\nu_{p}(n)$ denotes the exponent of $p$ in the prime decomposition of $n$.\n",
    "informal_proof": "If a number $n$ is a product of primes, $n=p_{1} p_{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_{k}$, then\n\n$$\nf(n)=f\\left(p_{1}\\right)+\\ldots+f\\left(p_{k}\\right)\n$$\n\nin particular, $f(1)=0$ (since $f(1)=f(1)+f(1)$ ).\n\nIt is also clear that $f(n)=0$ implies $f(p)=0$ for all primes $p$ dividing $n$.\n\nLet us call positive integer $n \\operatorname{good}$ if $f(k)=f(n-k)$ for $0<k<n$. If $n$ is good then each its divisor $d$ is also good; indeed, if $n=d m$ then\n\n$$\nf(k)=f(m k)-f(m)=f(n-m k)-f(m)=f(m(d-k))-f(m)=f(d-k)\n$$\n\nfor $0<k<d$. Thus, good numbers are products of good primes.\n\nIt follows immediately from (i) that there exists a prime $p$ such that $f(p) \\neq 0$; let $p$ be the smallest such prime. Then $f(r)=0$ for all $r<p$ (since all prime divisors of $r<p$ are less than $p$ ). Now every good number $n>p$ must be divisible by $p$. Indeed, if $n=p k+r$ is a good number, $k>0,0<r<p$, then $f(p) \\leqslant f(p k)=f(n-p k)=f(r)=0$, a contradiction. Since any divisor of a good number is also good, this means that if a divisor $r$ of a good number is not divisible by $p$, it is less than $p$. Thus all good numbers have the form $r \\cdot p^{k}$ with $r<p$. The condition (iii) implies that $k$ can be arbitrarily large, consequently all powers of $p$ are good.\n\nIf $q \\neq p$ is a prime, $p^{q-1}-1$ is divisible by $q$ and $p^{q-1}$ is good. Then $f(q) \\leqslant f\\left(p^{q-1}-1\\right)=$ $f(1)=0$, that is, $f(q)=0$.\n\nNow we see that $f(n)=\\nu_{p}(n) \\cdot c$, where $c=f(p)$. The conditions (i) and (ii) for all such functions with $c \\neq 0$ are obvious; the condition (iii) holds for all $n=p^{m}$, since $\\nu_{p}\\left(p^{m}-k\\right)=\\nu_{p}(k)$ when $0<k<p^{m}$."
