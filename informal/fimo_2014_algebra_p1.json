    "informal_statement": "Let $z_{0}<z_{1}<z_{2}<\\cdots$ be an infinite sequence of positive integers. Prove that there exists a unique integer $n \\geqslant 1$ such that\n\n$$\nz_{n}<\\frac{z_{0}+z_{1}+\\cdots+z_{n}}{n} \\leqslant z_{n+1} .\n$$",
    "informal_proof": "For $n=1,2, \\ldots$ define\n\n$$\nd_{n}=\\left(z_{0}+z_{1}+\\cdots+z_{n}\\right)-n z_{n} .\n$$\n\nThe sign of $d_{n}$ indicates whether the first inequality in (1) holds; i.e., it is satisfied if and only if $d_{n}>0$.\n\nNotice that\n\n$$\nn z_{n+1}-\\left(z_{0}+z_{1}+\\cdots+z_{n}\\right)=(n+1) z_{n+1}-\\left(z_{0}+z_{1}+\\cdots+z_{n}+z_{n+1}\\right)=-d_{n+1},\n$$\n\nso the second inequality in (1) is equivalent to $d_{n+1} \\leqslant 0$. Therefore, we have to prove that there is a unique index $n \\geqslant 1$ that satisfies $d_{n}>0 \\geqslant d_{n+1}$.\n\nBy its definition the sequence $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots$ consists of integers and we have\n\n$$\nd_{1}=\\left(z_{0}+z_{1}\\right)-1 \\cdot z_{1}=z_{0}>0 .\n$$\n\nFrom\n\n$d_{n+1}-d_{n}=\\left(\\left(z_{0}+\\cdots+z_{n}+z_{n+1}\\right)-(n+1) z_{n+1}\\right)-\\left(\\left(z_{0}+\\cdots+z_{n}\\right)-n z_{n}\\right)=n\\left(z_{n}-z_{n+1}\\right)<0$ we can see that $d_{n+1}<d_{n}$ and thus the sequence strictly decreases.\n\nHence, we have a decreasing sequence $d_{1}>d_{2}>\\ldots$ of integers such that its first element $d_{1}$ is positive. The sequence must drop below 0 at some point, and thus there is a unique index $n$, that is the index of the last positive term, satisfying $d_{n}>0 \\geqslant d_{n+1}$."
