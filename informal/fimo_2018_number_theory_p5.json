    "informal_statement": "Four positive integers $x, y, z$, and $t$ satisfy the relations\n\n$$\nx y-z t=x+y=z+t\n$$\n\nIs it possible that both $x y$ and $z t$ are perfect squares?\n\nThe final answer is no.",
    "informal_proof": "Arguing indirectly, assume that $x y=a^{2}$ and $z t=c^{2}$ with $a, c>0$.\n\nSuppose that the number $x+y=z+t$ is odd. Then $x$ and $y$ have opposite parity, as well as $z$ and $t$. This means that both $x y$ and $z t$ are even, as well as $x y-z t=x+y$; a contradiction. Thus, $x+y$ is even, so the number $s=\\frac{x+y}{2}=\\frac{z+t}{2}$ is a positive integer.\n\nNext, we set $b=\\frac{|x-y|}{2}, d=\\frac{|z-t|}{2}$. Now the problem conditions yield\n\n$$\ns^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}=c^{2}+d^{2}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\n2 s=a^{2}-c^{2}=d^{2}-b^{2}\n$$\n\n(the last equality in (2) follows from (1)). We readily get from (2) that $a, d>0$.\n\nIn the sequel we will use only the relations (1) and (2), along with the fact that $a, d, s$ are positive integers, while $b$ and $c$ are nonnegative integers, at most one of which may be zero. Since both relations are symmetric with respect to the simultaneous swappings $a \\leftrightarrow d$ and $b \\leftrightarrow c$, we assume, without loss of generality, that $b \\geqslant c$ (and hence $b>0$ ). Therefore, $d^{2}=2 s+b^{2}>c^{2}$, whence\n\n$$\nd^{2}>\\frac{c^{2}+d^{2}}{2}=\\frac{s^{2}}{2}\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, since $d^{2}-b^{2}$ is even by (2), the numbers $b$ and $d$ have the same parity, so $0<b \\leqslant d-2$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n2 s=d^{2}-b^{2} \\geqslant d^{2}-(d-2)^{2}=4(d-1), \\quad \\text { i.e., } \\quad d \\leqslant \\frac{s}{2}+1\n$$\n\nCombining (3) and (4) we obtain\n\n$$\n2 s^{2}<4 d^{2} \\leqslant 4\\left(\\frac{s}{2}+1\\right)^{2}, \\quad \\text { or } \\quad(s-2)^{2}<8\n$$\n\nwhich yields $s \\leqslant 4$.\n\nFinally, an easy check shows that each number of the form $s^{2}$ with $1 \\leqslant s \\leqslant 4$ has a unique representation as a sum of two squares, namely $s^{2}=s^{2}+0^{2}$. Thus, (1) along with $a, d>0$ imply $b=c=0$, which is impossible."
