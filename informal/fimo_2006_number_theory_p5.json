    "informal_proof": "The equation has no integer solutions. To show this, we first prove a lemma.\n\nLemma. If $x$ is an integer and $p$ is a prime divisor of $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}$ then either $p \\equiv 1(\\bmod 7)$ or $p=7$.\n\nProof. Both $x^{7}-1$ and $x^{p-1}-1$ are divisible by $p$, by hypothesis and by Fermat's little theorem, respectively. Suppose that 7 does not divide $p-1$. Then $\\operatorname{gcd}(p-1,7)=1$, so there exist integers $k$ and $m$ such that $7 k+(p-1) m=1$. We therefore have\n\n$$\nx \\equiv x^{7 k+(p-1) m} \\equiv\\left(x^{7}\\right)^{k} \\cdot\\left(x^{p-1}\\right)^{m} \\equiv 1 \\quad(\\bmod p),\n$$\n\nand so\n\n$$\n\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}=1+x+\\cdots+x^{6} \\equiv 7 \\quad(\\bmod p) .\n$$\n\nIt follows that $p$ divides 7 , hence $p=7$ must hold if $p \\equiv 1(\\bmod 7)$ does not, as stated.\n\nThe lemma shows that each positive divisor $d$ of $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}$ satisfies either $d \\equiv 0(\\bmod 7)$ or $d \\equiv 1(\\bmod 7)$\n\nNow assume that $(x, y)$ is an integer solution of the original equation. Notice that $y-1>0$, because $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}>0$ for all $x \\neq 1$. Since $y-1$ divides $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}=y^{5}-1$, we have $y \\equiv 1(\\bmod 7)$ or $y \\equiv 2(\\bmod 7)$ by the previous paragraph. In the first case, $1+y+y^{2}+y^{3}+y^{4} \\equiv 5(\\bmod 7)$, and in the second $1+y+y^{2}+y^{3}+y^{4} \\equiv 3(\\bmod 7)$. Both possibilities contradict the fact that the positive divisor $1+y+y^{2}+y^{3}+y^{4}$ of $\\frac{x^{7}-1}{x-1}$ is congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 7 . So the given equation has no integer solutions."
