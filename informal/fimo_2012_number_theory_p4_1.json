    "informal_statement": "An integer $a$ is called friendly if the equation $\\left(m^{2}+n\\right)\\left(n^{2}+m\\right)=a(m-n)^{3}$ has a solution over the positive integers.\n\nProve that there are at least 500 friendly integers in the set $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2012\\}$.",
    "informal_proof": "Every $a$ of the form $a=4 k-3$ with $k \\geq 2$ is friendly. Indeed the numbers $m=2 k-1>0$ and $n=k-1>0$ satisfy the given equation with $a=4 k-3$ :\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}+n\\right)\\left(n^{2}+m\\right)=\\left((2 k-1)^{2}+(k-1)\\right)\\left((k-1)^{2}+(2 k-1)\\right)=(4 k-3) k^{3}=a(m-n)^{3} .\n$$\n\nHence $5,9, \\ldots, 2009$ are friendly and so $\\{1,2, \\ldots, 2012\\}$ contains at least 502 friendly numbers."
