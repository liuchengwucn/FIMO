    "informal_statement": "Show that for all real numbers $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ the following inequality holds:\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sqrt{\\left|x_{i}-x_{j}\\right|} \\leqslant \\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sqrt{\\left|x_{i}+x_{j}\\right|}\n$$",
    "informal_proof": "If we add $t$ to all the variables then the left-hand side remains constant and the right-hand side becomes\n\n$$\nH(t):=\\sum_{i=1}^{n} \\sum_{j=1}^{n} \\sqrt{\\left|x_{i}+x_{j}+2 t\\right|}\n$$\n\nLet $T$ be large enough such that both $H(-T)$ and $H(T)$ are larger than the value $L$ of the lefthand side of the inequality we want to prove. Not necessarily distinct points $p_{i, j}:=-\\left(x_{i}+x_{j}\\right) / 2$ together with $T$ and $-T$ split the real line into segments and two rays such that on each of these segments and rays the function $H(t)$ is concave since $f(t):=\\sqrt{|\\ell+2 t|}$ is concave on both intervals $(-\\infty,-\\ell / 2]$ and $[-\\ell / 2,+\\infty)$. Let $[a, b]$ be the segment containing zero. Then concavity implies $H(0) \\geqslant \\min \\{H(a), H(b)\\}$ and, since $H(\\pm T)>L$, it suffices to prove the inequalities $H\\left(-\\left(x_{i}+x_{j}\\right) / 2\\right) \\geqslant L$, that is to prove the original inequality in the case when all numbers are shifted in such a way that two variables $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ add up to zero. In the following we denote the shifted variables still by $x_{i}$.\n\nIf $i=j$, i.e. $x_{i}=0$ for some index $i$, then we can remove $x_{i}$ which will decrease both sides by $2 \\sum_{k} \\sqrt{\\left|x_{k}\\right|}$. Similarly, if $x_{i}+x_{j}=0$ for distinct $i$ and $j$ we can remove both $x_{i}$ and $x_{j}$ which decreases both sides by\n\n$$\n2 \\sqrt{2\\left|x_{i}\\right|}+2 \\cdot \\sum_{k \\neq i, j}\\left(\\sqrt{\\left|x_{k}+x_{i}\\right|}+\\sqrt{\\left|x_{k}+x_{j}\\right|}\\right)\n$$\n\nIn either case we reduced our inequality to the case of smaller $n$. It remains to note that for $n=0$ and $n=1$ the inequality is trivial."
