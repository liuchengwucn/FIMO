    "informal_statement": "An integer $a$ is called friendly if the equation $\\left(m^{2}+n\\right)\\left(n^{2}+m\\right)=a(m-n)^{3}$ has a solution over the positive integers.\n\nDecide whether $a=2$ is friendly.\n\nThe final answer is that $a=2$ is not friendly.",
    "informal_proof": "We show that $a=2$ is not friendly. Consider the equation with $a=2$ and rewrite its left-hand side as a difference of squares:\n\n$$\n\\frac{1}{4}\\left(\\left(m^{2}+n+n^{2}+m\\right)^{2}-\\left(m^{2}+n-n^{2}-m\\right)^{2}\\right)=2(m-n)^{3} .\n$$\n\nSince $m^{2}+n-n^{2}-m=(m-n)(m+n-1)$, we can further reformulate the equation as\n\n$$\n\\left(m^{2}+n+n^{2}+m\\right)^{2}=(m-n)^{2}\\left(8(m-n)+(m+n-1)^{2}\\right) .\n$$\n\nIt follows that $8(m-n)+(m+n-1)^{2}$ is a perfect square. Clearly $m>n$, hence there is an integer $s \\geq 1$ such that\n\n$$\n(m+n-1+2 s)^{2}=8(m-n)+(m+n-1)^{2} .\n$$\n\nSubtracting the squares gives $s(m+n-1+s)=2(m-n)$. Since $m+n-1+s>m-n$, we conclude that $s<2$. Therefore the only possibility is $s=1$ and $m=3 n$. However then the left-hand side of the given equation (with $a=2$ ) is greater than $m^{3}=27 n^{3}$, whereas its right-hand side equals $16 n^{3}$. The contradiction proves that $a=2$ is not friendly."
