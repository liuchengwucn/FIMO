    "informal_statement": "Let $b, n>1$ be integers. Suppose that for each $k>1$ there exists an integer $a_{k}$ such that $b-a_{k}^{n}$ is divisible by $k$. Prove that $b=A^{n}$ for some integer $A$.",
    "informal_proof": "Let the prime factorization of $b$ be $b=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1}} \\ldots p_{s}^{\\alpha_{s}}$, where $p_{1}, \\ldots, p_{s}$ are distinct primes. Our goal is to show that all exponents $\\alpha_{i}$ are divisible by $n$, then we can set $A=p_{1}^{\\alpha_{1} / n} \\ldots p_{s}^{\\alpha_{s} / n}$.\n\nApply the condition for $k=b^{2}$. The number $b-a_{k}^{n}$ is divisible by $b^{2}$ and hence, for each $1 \\leq i \\leq s$, it is divisible by $p_{i}^{2 \\alpha_{i}}>p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}$ as well. Therefore\n\n$$\na_{k}^{n} \\equiv b \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}\\right)\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\na_{k}^{n} \\equiv b \\not \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}+1}\\right),\n$$\n\nwhich implies that the largest power of $p_{i}$ dividing $a_{k}^{n}$ is $p_{i}^{\\alpha_{i}}$. Since $a_{k}^{n}$ is a complete $n$th power, this implies that $\\alpha_{i}$ is divisible by $n$."
