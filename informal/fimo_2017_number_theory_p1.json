    "informal_proof": "Since the value of $a_{n+1}$ only depends on the value of $a_{n}$, if $a_{n}=a_{m}$ for two different indices $n$ and $m$, then the sequence is eventually periodic. So we look for the values of $a_{0}$ for which the sequence is eventually periodic.\n\nClaim 1. If $a_{n} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)$, then, for all $m>n, a_{m}$ is not a perfect square. It follows that the sequence is eventually strictly increasing, so it is not eventually periodic.\n\nProof. A square cannot be congruent to $-1$ modulo 3 , so $a_{n} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)$ implies that $a_{n}$ is not a square, therefore $a_{n+1}=a_{n}+3>a_{n}$. As a consequence, $a_{n+1} \\equiv a_{n} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)$, so $a_{n+1}$ is not a square either. By repeating the argument, we prove that, from $a_{n}$ on, all terms of the sequence are not perfect squares and are greater than their predecessors, which completes the proof.\n\nClaim 2. If $a_{n} \\not=-1(\\bmod 3)$ and $a_{n}>9$ then there is an index $m>n$ such that $a_{m}<a_{n}$.\n\nProof. Let $t^{2}$ be the largest perfect square which is less than $a_{n}$. Since $a_{n}>9, t$ is at least 3. The first square in the sequence $a_{n}, a_{n}+3, a_{n}+6, \\ldots$ will be $(t+1)^{2},(t+2)^{2}$ or $(t+3)^{2}$, therefore there is an index $m>n$ such that $a_{m} \\leqslant t+3<t^{2}<a_{n}$, as claimed.\n\nClaim 3. If $a_{n} \\equiv 0(\\bmod 3)$, then there is an index $m>n$ such that $a_{m}=3$.\n\nProof. First we notice that, by the definition of the sequence, a multiple of 3 is always followed by another multiple of 3 . If $a_{n} \\in\\{3,6,9\\}$ the sequence will eventually follow the periodic pattern $3,6,9,3,6,9, \\ldots$. If $a_{n}>9$, let $j$ be an index such that $a_{j}$ is equal to the minimum value of the set $\\left\\{a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \\ldots\\right\\}$. We must have $a_{j} \\leqslant 9$, otherwise we could apply Claim 2 to $a_{j}$ and get a contradiction on the minimality hypothesis. It follows that $a_{j} \\in\\{3,6,9\\}$, and the proof is complete.\n\nClaim 4. If $a_{n} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)$, then there is an index $m>n$ such that $a_{m} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)$.\n\nProof. In the sequence, 4 is always followed by $2 \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)$, so the claim is true for $a_{n}=4$. If $a_{n}=7$, the next terms will be $10,13,16,4,2, \\ldots$ and the claim is also true. For $a_{n} \\geqslant 10$, we again take an index $j>n$ such that $a_{j}$ is equal to the minimum value of the set $\\left\\{a_{n+1}, a_{n+2}, \\ldots\\right\\}$, which by the definition of the sequence consists of non-multiples of 3 . Suppose $a_{j} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)$. Then we must have $a_{j} \\leqslant 9$ by Claim 2 and the minimality of $a_{j}$. It follows that $a_{j} \\in\\{4,7\\}$, so $a_{m}=2<a_{j}$ for some $m>j$, contradicting the minimality of $a_{j}$. Therefore, we must have $a_{j} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)$\n\nIt follows from the previous claims that if $a_{0}$ is a multiple of 3 the sequence will eventually reach the periodic pattern $3,6,9,3,6,9, \\ldots$; if $a_{0} \\equiv-1(\\bmod 3)$ the sequence will be strictly increasing; and if $a_{0} \\equiv 1(\\bmod 3)$ the sequence will be eventually strictly increasing.\n\nSo the sequence will be eventually periodic if, and only if, $a_{0}$ is a multiple of 3 ."
