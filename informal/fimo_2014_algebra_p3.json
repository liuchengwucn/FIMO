    "informal_statement": "For a sequence $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ of real numbers, we define its price as\n\n$$\n\\max _{1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n}\\left|x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{i}\\right| .\n$$\n\nGiven $n$ real numbers, Dave and George want to arrange them into a sequence with a low price. Diligent Dave checks all possible ways and finds the minimum possible price $D$. Greedy George, on the other hand, chooses $x_{1}$ such that $\\left|x_{1}\\right|$ is as small as possible; among the remaining numbers, he chooses $x_{2}$ such that $\\left|x_{1}+x_{2}\\right|$ is as small as possible, and so on. Thus, in the $i^{\\text {th }}$ step he chooses $x_{i}$ among the remaining numbers so as to minimise the value of $\\left|x_{1}+x_{2}+\\cdots+x_{i}\\right|$. In each step, if several numbers provide the same value, George chooses one at random. Finally he gets a sequence with price $G$.\n\nFind the least possible constant $c$ such that for every positive integer $n$, for every collection of $n$ real numbers, and for every possible sequence that George might obtain, the resulting values satisfy the inequality $G \\leqslant c D$.\n\nThe final answer is $c=2$.",
    "informal_proof": "If the initial numbers are $1,-1,2$, and $-2$, then Dave may arrange them as $1,-2,2,-1$, while George may get the sequence $1,-1,2,-2$, resulting in $D=1$ and $G=2$. So we obtain $c \\geqslant 2$.\n\nTherefore, it remains to prove that $G \\leqslant 2 D$. Let $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}$ be the numbers Dave and George have at their disposal. Assume that Dave and George arrange them into sequences $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{n}$ and $g_{1}, g_{2}, \\ldots, g_{n}$, respectively. Put\n\n$$\nM=\\max _{1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n}\\left|x_{i}\\right|, \\quad S=\\left|x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{n}\\right|, \\quad \\text { and } \\quad N=\\max \\{M, S\\}\n$$\n\nWe claim that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& D \\geqslant S, \\\\\n& D \\geqslant \\frac{M}{2}, \\quad \\text { and } \\\\\n& G \\leqslant N=\\max \\{M, S\\} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nThese inequalities yield the desired estimate, as $G \\leqslant \\max \\{M, S\\} \\leqslant \\max \\{M, 2 S\\} \\leqslant 2 D$.\n\nThe inequality (1) is a direct consequence of the definition of the price.\n\nTo prove (2), consider an index $i$ with $\\left|d_{i}\\right|=M$. Then we have\n\n$M=\\left|d_{i}\\right|=\\left|\\left(d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}\\right)-\\left(d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i-1}\\right)\\right| \\leqslant\\left|d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i}\\right|+\\left|d_{1}+\\cdots+d_{i-1}\\right| \\leqslant 2 D$,\n\nas required.\n\nIt remains to establish (3). Put $h_{i}=g_{1}+g_{2}+\\cdots+g_{i}$. We will prove by induction on $i$ that $\\left|h_{i}\\right| \\leqslant N$. The base case $i=1$ holds, since $\\left|h_{1}\\right|=\\left|g_{1}\\right| \\leqslant M \\leqslant N$. Notice also that $\\left|h_{n}\\right|=S \\leqslant N$.\n\nFor the induction step, assume that $\\left|h_{i-1}\\right| \\leqslant N$. We distinguish two cases.\n\nCase 1. Assume that no two of the numbers $g_{i}, g_{i+1}, \\ldots, g_{n}$ have opposite signs.\n\nWithout loss of generality, we may assume that they are all nonnegative. Then one has $h_{i-1} \\leqslant h_{i} \\leqslant \\cdots \\leqslant h_{n}$, thus\n\n$$\n\\left|h_{i}\\right| \\leqslant \\max \\left\\{\\left|h_{i-1}\\right|,\\left|h_{n}\\right|\\right\\} \\leqslant N .\n$$\n\nCase 2. Among the numbers $g_{i}, g_{i+1}, \\ldots, g_{n}$ there are positive and negative ones. Then there exists some index $j \\geqslant i$ such that $h_{i-1} g_{j} \\leqslant 0$. By the definition of George's sequence we have\n\n$$\n\\left|h_{i}\\right|=\\left|h_{i-1}+g_{i}\\right| \\leqslant\\left|h_{i-1}+g_{j}\\right| \\leqslant \\max \\left\\{\\left|h_{i-1}\\right|,\\left|g_{j}\\right|\\right\\} \\leqslant N\n$$\n\nThus, the induction step is established."
