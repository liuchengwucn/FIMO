{"problem_name": "imosl_2011_algebra_p3", "informal_statement": "Determine all pairs $(f, g)$ of functions from the set of real numbers to itself that satisfy\n\n$$\ng(f(x+y))=f(x)+(2 x+y) g(y)\n$$\n\nfor all real numbers $x$ and $y$.\n\nThe final answer is that either both $f$ and $g$ vanish identically, or there exists a real number $C$ such that $f(x)=x^{2}+C$ and $g(x)=x$ for all real numbers $x$.", "informal_proof": "Solution. Clearly all these pairs of functions satisfy the functional equation in question, so it suffices to verify that there cannot be any further ones. Substituting $-2 x$ for $y$ in the given functional equation we obtain\n\n$$\ng(f(-x))=f(x) .\n$$\n\nUsing this equation for $-x-y$ in place of $x$ we obtain\n\n$$\nf(-x-y)=g(f(x+y))=f(x)+(2 x+y) g(y)\n$$\n\nNow for any two real numbers $a$ and $b$, setting $x=-b$ and $y=a+b$ we get\n\n$$\nf(-a)=f(-b)+(a-b) g(a+b) .\n$$\n\nIf $c$ denotes another arbitrary real number we have similarly\n\n$$\nf(-b)=f(-c)+(b-c) g(b+c)\n$$\n\nas well as\n\n$$\nf(-c)=f(-a)+(c-a) g(c+a) .\n$$\n\nAdding all these equations up, we obtain\n\n$$\n((a+c)-(b+c)) g(a+b)+((a+b)-(a+c)) g(b+c)+((b+c)-(a+b)) g(a+c)=0 .\n$$\n\nNow given any three real numbers $x, y$, and $z$ one may determine three reals $a, b$, and $c$ such that $x=b+c, y=c+a$, and $z=a+b$, so that we get\n\n$$\n(y-x) g(z)+(z-y) g(x)+(x-z) g(y)=0 .\n$$\n\nThis implies that the three points $(x, g(x)),(y, g(y))$, and $(z, g(z))$ from the graph of $g$ are collinear. Hence that graph is a line, i.e., $g$ is either a constant or a linear function. Let us write $g(x)=A x+B$, where $A$ and $B$ are two real numbers. Substituting $(0,-y)$ for $(x, y)$ in (2) and denoting $C=f(0)$, we have $f(y)=A y^{2}-B y+C$. Now, comparing the coefficients of $x^{2}$ in (1) we see that $A^{2}=A$, so $A=0$ or $A=1$.\n\nIf $A=0$, then (1) becomes $B=-B x+C$ and thus $B=C=0$, which provides the first of the two solutions mentioned above.\n\nNow suppose $A=1$. Then (1) becomes $x^{2}-B x+C+B=x^{2}-B x+C$, so $B=0$. Thus, $g(x)=x$ and $f(x)=x^{2}+C$, which is the second solution from above."}
