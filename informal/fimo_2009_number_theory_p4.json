    "informal_proof": "Such a sequence exists for $n=1,2,3,4$ and no other $n$. Since the existence of such a sequence for some $n$ implies the existence of such a sequence for all smaller $n$, it suffices to prove that $n=5$ is not possible and $n=4$ is possible.\n\nAssume first that for $n=5$ there exists a sequence of positive integers $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{5}$ satisfying the conditions\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\n& a_{2}^{2}+1=\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{3}+1\\right), \\\\\n& a_{3}^{2}+1=\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right), \\\\\n& a_{4}^{2}+1=\\left(a_{3}+1\\right)\\left(a_{5}+1\\right) .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAssume $a_{1}$ is odd, then $a_{2}$ has to be odd as well and as then $a_{2}^{2}+1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 4, a_{3}$ has to be even. But this is a contradiction, since then the even number $a_{2}+1$ cannot divide the odd number $a_{3}^{2}+1$.\n\nHence $a_{1}$ is even.\n\nIf $a_{2}$ is odd, $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is even (as a multiple of $\\left.a_{2}+1\\right)$ and hence $a_{3}$ is odd, too. Similarly we must have $a_{4}$ odd as well. But then $a_{3}^{2}+1$ is a product of two even numbers $\\left(a_{2}+1\\right)\\left(a_{4}+1\\right)$ and thus is divisible by 4 , which is a contradiction as for odd $a_{3}$ we have $a_{3}^{2}+1 \\equiv 2 \\bmod 4$.\n\nHence $a_{2}$ is even. Furthermore $a_{3}+1$ divides the odd number $a_{2}^{2}+1$ and so $a_{3}$ is even. Similarly, $a_{4}$ and $a_{5}$ are even as well.\n\nNow set $x=a_{2}$ and $y=a_{3}$. From the given condition we get $(x+1) \\mid\\left(y^{2}+1\\right)$ and $(y+1) \\mid\\left(x^{2}+1\\right)$. We will prove that there is no pair of positive even numbers $(x, y)$ satisfying these two conditions, thus yielding a contradiction to the assumption.\n\nAssume there exists a pair $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$ of positive even numbers satisfying the two conditions $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1\\right)$ and $\\left(y_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+1\\right)$.\n\nThen one has $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1+x_{0}^{2}-1\\right)$, i.e., $\\left(x_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)$, and similarly $\\left(y_{0}+1\\right) \\mid\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)$. Any common divisor $d$ of $x_{0}+1$ and $y_{0}+1$ must hence also divide the number $\\left(x_{0}^{2}+1\\right)+\\left(y_{0}^{2}+1\\right)-\\left(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2}\\right)=2$. But as $x_{0}+1$ and $y_{0}+1$ are both odd, we must have $d=1$. Thus $x_{0}+1$ and $y_{0}+1$ are relatively prime and therefore there exists a positive integer $k$ such that\n\n$$\nk(x+1)(y+1)=x^{2}+y^{2}\n$$\n\nhas the solution $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}\\right)$. We will show that the latter equation has no solution $(x, y)$ in positive even numbers.\n\nAssume there is a solution. Pick the solution $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ with the smallest sum $x_{1}+y_{1}$ and assume $x_{1} \\geq y_{1}$. Then $x_{1}$ is a solution to the quadratic equation\n\n$$\nx^{2}-k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right) x+y_{1}^{2}-k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)=0 .\n$$\n\nLet $x_{2}$ be the second solution, which by VIETA's theorem fulfills $x_{1}+x_{2}=k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)$ and $x_{1} x_{2}=y_{1}^{2}-k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)$. If $x_{2}=0$, the second equation implies $y_{1}^{2}=k\\left(y_{1}+1\\right)$, which is impossible, as $y_{1}+1>1$ cannot divide the relatively prime number $y_{1}^{2}$. Therefore $x_{2} \\neq 0$.\n\nAlso we get $\\left(x_{1}+1\\right)\\left(x_{2}+1\\right)=x_{1} x_{2}+x_{1}+x_{2}+1=y_{1}^{2}+1$ which is odd, and hence $x_{2}$ must be even and positive. Also we have $x_{2}+1=\\frac{y_{1}^{2}+1}{x_{1}+1} \\leq \\frac{y_{1}^{2}+1}{y_{1}+1} \\leq y_{1} \\leq x_{1}$. But this means that the pair $\\left(x^{\\prime}, y^{\\prime}\\right)$ with $x^{\\prime}=y_{1}$ and $y^{\\prime}=x_{2}$ is another solution of $k(x+1)(y+1)=x^{2}+y^{2}$ in even positive numbers with $x^{\\prime}+y^{\\prime}<x_{1}+y_{1}$, a contradiction.\n\nTherefore we must have $n \\leq 4$.\n\nWhen $n=4$, a possible example of a sequence is $a_{1}=4, a_{2}=33, a_{3}=217$ and $a_{4}=1384$."
