    "informal_statement": "Determine all functions $f$ from the set of positive integers into the set of positive integers such that for all $x$ and $y$ there exists a non degenerated triangle with sides of lengths\n\n$$\nx, \\quad f(y) \\text { and } f(y+f(x)-1) .\n$$\n\nThe final answer is the identity function $f(x)=x$.",
    "informal_proof": "The identity function $f(x)=x$ is the only solution of the problem.\n\nIf $f(x)=x$ for all positive integers $x$, the given three lengths are $x, y=f(y)$ and $z=$ $f(y+f(x)-1)=x+y-1$. Because of $x \\geq 1, y \\geq 1$ we have $z \\geq \\max \\{x, y\\}>|x-y|$ and $z<x+y$. From this it follows that a triangle with these side lengths exists and does not degenerate. We prove in several steps that there is no other solution.\n\nStep 1. We show $f(1)=1$\n\nIf we had $f(1)=1+m>1$ we would conclude $f(y)=f(y+m)$ for all $y$ considering the triangle with the side lengths $1, f(y)$ and $f(y+m)$. Thus, $f$ would be $m$-periodic and, consequently, bounded. Let $B$ be a bound, $f(x) \\leq B$. If we choose $x>2 B$ we obtain the contradiction $x>2 B \\geq f(y)+f(y+f(x)-1)$.\n\nStep 2. For all positive integers $z$, we have $f(f(z))=z$.\n\nSetting $x=z$ and $y=1$ this follows immediately from Step 1.\n\nStep 3. For all integers $z \\geq 1$, we have $f(z) \\leq z$.\n\nLet us show, that the contrary leads to a contradiction. Assume $w+1=f(z)>z$ for some $z$. From Step 1 we know that $w \\geq z \\geq 2$. Let $M=\\max \\{f(1), f(2), \\ldots, f(w)\\}$ be the largest value of $f$ for the first $w$ integers. First we show, that no positive integer $t$ exists with\n\n$$\nf(t)>\\frac{z-1}{w} \\cdot t+M\n$$\n\notherwise we decompose the smallest value $t$ as $t=w r+s$ where $r$ is an integer and $1 \\leq s \\leq w$. Because of the definition of $M$, we have $t>w$. Setting $x=z$ and $y=t-w$ we get from the triangle inequality\n\n$$\nz+f(t-w)>f((t-w)+f(z)-1)=f(t-w+w)=f(t) .\n$$\n\nHence,\n\n$$\nf(t-w) \\geq f(t)-(z-1)>\\frac{z-1}{w}(t-w)+M,\n$$\n\na contradiction to the minimality of $t$.\n\nTherefore the inequality (1) fails for all $t \\geq 1$, we have proven\n\n$$\nf(t) \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w} \\cdot t+M\n$$\n\ninstead. Now, using (2), we finish the proof of Step 3. Because of $z \\leq w$ we have $\\frac{z-1}{w}<1$ and we can choose an integer $t$ sufficiently large to fulfill the condition\n\n$$\n\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w}\\right)^{2} t+\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w}+1\\right) M<t\n$$\n\nApplying (2) twice we get\n\n$$\nf(f(t)) \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w} f(t)+M \\leq \\frac{z-1}{w}\\left(\\frac{z-1}{w} t+M\\right)+M<t\n$$\n\nin contradiction to Step 2, which proves Step 3.\n\nFinal step. Thus, following Step 2 and Step 3, we obtain\n\n$$\nz=f(f(z)) \\leq f(z) \\leq z\n$$\n\nand $f(z)=z$ for all positive integers $z$ is proven."
