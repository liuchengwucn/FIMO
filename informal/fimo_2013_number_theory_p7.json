    "informal_proof": "For positive integers $a$ and $b$, let us denote\n\n$$\nf(a, b)=a\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-b\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor .\n$$\n\nWe will deal with various values of $m$; thus it is convenient to say that a pair $(a, b)$ is $m$-good or m-excellent if the corresponding conditions are satisfied.\n\nTo start, let us investigate how the values $f(a+b, b)$ and $f(a, b+a)$ are related to $f(a, b)$. If $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{b \\nu\\}<1$, then we have $\\lfloor(a+b) \\nu\\rfloor=\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor+\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor$ and $\\lceil(a+b) \\nu\\rceil=\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil+\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-1$, so\n\n$$\nf(a+b, b)=(a+b)\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-b(\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor+\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b(\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil-\\lfloor b \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b)+b\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nf(a, b+a)=a(\\lceil b \\nu\\rceil+\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil-1)-(b+a)\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor=f(a, b)+a(\\lceil a \\nu\\rceil-1-\\lfloor a \\nu\\rfloor)=f(a, b) .\n$$\n\nSimilarly, if $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{b \\nu\\} \\geqslant 1$ then one obtains\n\n$$\nf(a+b, b)=f(a, b) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)+a .\n$$\n\nSo, in both cases one of the numbers $f(a+b, a)$ and $f(a, b+a)$ is equal to $f(a, b)$ while the other is greater than $f(a, b)$ by one of $a$ and $b$. Thus, exactly one of the pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ is excellent (for an appropriate value of $m$ ).\n\nNow let us say that the pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ are the children of the pair $(a, b)$, while this pair is their parent. Next, if a pair $(c, d)$ can be obtained from $(a, b)$ by several passings from a parent to a child, we will say that $(c, d)$ is a descendant of $(a, b)$, while $(a, b)$ is an ancestor of $(c, d)$ (a pair is neither an ancestor nor a descendant of itself). Thus each pair $(a, b)$ has two children, it has a unique parent if $a \\neq b$, and no parents otherwise. Therefore, each pair of distinct positive integers has a unique ancestor of the form $(a, a)$; our aim is now to find how many m-excellent descendants each such pair has.\n\nNotice now that if a pair $(a, b)$ is m-excellent then $\\min \\{a, b\\} \\leqslant m$. Indeed, if $a=b$ then $f(a, a)=a=m$, so the statement is valid. Otherwise, the pair $(a, b)$ is a child of some pair $\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)$. If $b=b^{\\prime}$ and $a=a^{\\prime}+b^{\\prime}$, then we should have $m=f(a, b)=f\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)+b^{\\prime}$, so $b=b^{\\prime}=m-f\\left(a^{\\prime}, b^{\\prime}\\right)<m$. Similarly, if $a=a^{\\prime}$ and $b=b^{\\prime}+a^{\\prime}$ then $a<m$.\n\nLet us consider the set $S_{m}$ of all pairs $(a, b)$ such that $f(a, b) \\leqslant m$ and $\\min \\{a, b\\} \\leqslant m$. Then all the ancestors of the elements in $S_{m}$ are again in $S_{m}$, and each element in $S_{m}$ either is of the form $(a, a)$ with $a \\leqslant m$, or has a unique ancestor of this form. From the arguments above we see that all $m$-excellent pairs lie in $S_{m}$.\n\nWe claim now that the set $S_{m}$ is finite. Indeed, assume, for instance, that it contains infinitely many pairs $(c, d)$ with $d>2 m$. Such a pair is necessarily a child of $(c, d-c)$, and thus a descendant of some pair $\\left(c, d^{\\prime}\\right)$ with $m<d^{\\prime} \\leqslant 2 m$. Therefore, one of the pairs $(a, b) \\in S_{m}$ with $m<b \\leqslant 2 m$ has infinitely many descendants in $S_{m}$, and all these descendants have the form $(a, b+k a)$ with $k$ a positive integer. Since $f(a, b+k a)$ does not decrease as $k$ grows, it becomes constant for $k \\geqslant k_{0}$, where $k_{0}$ is some positive integer. This means that $\\{a \\nu\\}+\\{(b+k a) \\nu\\}<1$ for all $k \\geqslant k_{0}$. But this yields $1>\\{(b+k a) \\nu\\}=\\left\\{\\left(b+k_{0} a\\right) \\nu\\right\\}+\\left(k-k_{0}\\right)\\{a \\nu\\}$ for all $k>k_{0}$, which is absurd.\n\nSimilarly, one can prove that $S_{m}$ contains finitely many pairs $(c, d)$ with $c>2 m$, thus finitely many elements at all.\n\nWe are now prepared for proving the following crucial lemma.\n\nLemma. Consider any pair $(a, b)$ with $f(a, b) \\neq m$. Then the number $g(a, b)$ of its $m$-excellent descendants is equal to the number $h(a, b)$ of ways to represent the number $t=m-f(a, b)$ as $t=k a+\\ell b$ with $k$ and $\\ell$ being some nonnegative integers.\n\nProof. We proceed by induction on the number $N$ of descendants of $(a, b)$ in $S_{m}$. If $N=0$ then clearly $g(a, b)=0$. Assume that $h(a, b)>0$; without loss of generality, we have $a \\leqslant b$. Then, clearly, $m-f(a, b) \\geqslant a$, so $f(a, b+a) \\leqslant f(a, b)+a \\leqslant m$ and $a \\leqslant m$, hence $(a, b+a) \\in S_{m}$ which is impossible. Thus in the base case we have $g(a, b)=h(a, b)=0$, as desired.\n\nNow let $N>0$. Assume that $f(a+b, b)=f(a, b)+b$ and $f(a, b+a)=f(a, b)$ (the other case is similar). If $f(a, b)+b \\neq m$, then by the induction hypothesis we have\n\n$$\ng(a, b)=g(a+b, b)+g(a, b+a)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a) .\n$$\n\nNotice that both pairs $(a+b, b)$ and $(a, b+a)$ are descendants of $(a, b)$ and thus each of them has strictly less descendants in $S_{m}$ than $(a, b)$ does.\n\nNext, each one of the $h(a+b, b)$ representations of $m-f(a+b, b)=m-b-f(a, b)$ as the sum $k^{\\prime}(a+b)+\\ell^{\\prime} b$ provides the representation $m-f(a, b)=k a+\\ell b$ with $k=k^{\\prime}<k^{\\prime}+\\ell^{\\prime}+1=\\ell$. Similarly, each one of the $h(a, b+a)$ representations of $m-f(a, b+a)=m-f(a, b)$ as the sum $k^{\\prime} a+\\ell^{\\prime}(b+a)$ provides the representation $m-f(a, b)=k a+\\ell b$ with $k=k^{\\prime}+\\ell^{\\prime} \\geqslant \\ell^{\\prime}=\\ell$. This correspondence is obviously bijective, so\n\n$$\nh(a, b)=h(a+b, b)+h(a, b+a)=g(a, b),\n$$\n\nas required.\n\nFinally, if $f(a, b)+b=m$ then $(a+b, b)$ is m-excellent, so $g(a, b)=1+g(a, b+a)=1+h(a, b+a)$ by the induction hypothesis. On the other hand, the number $m-f(a, b)=b$ has a representation $0 \\cdot a+1 \\cdot b$ and sometimes one more representation as $k a+0 \\cdot b$; this last representation exists simultaneously with the representation $m-f(a, b+a)=k a+0 \\cdot(b+a)$, so $h(a, b)=1+h(a, b+a)$ as well. Thus in this case the step is also proved.\n\nNow it is easy to finish the solution. There exists a unique $m$-excellent pair of the form $(a, a)$, and each other $m$-excellent pair $(a, b)$ has a unique ancestor of the form $(x, x)$ with $x<m$. By the lemma, for every $x<m$ the number of its $m$-excellent descendants is $h(x, x)$, which is the number of ways to represent $m-f(x, x)=m-x$ as $k x+\\ell x$ (with nonnegative integer $k$ and $\\ell$ ). This number is 0 if $x \\backslash m$, and $m / x$ otherwise. So the total number of excellent pairs is\n\n$$\n1+\\sum_{x \\mid m, x<m} \\frac{m}{x}=1+\\sum_{d \\mid m, d>1} d=\\sum_{d \\mid m} d\n$$\n\nas required."
