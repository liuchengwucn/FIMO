{"problem_name": "imosl_2019_number_theory_p3", "informal_statement": "We say that a set $S$ of integers is rootiful if, for any positive integer $n$ and any $a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n} \\in S$, all integer roots of the polynomial $a_{0}+a_{1} x+\\cdots+a_{n} x^{n}$ are also in $S$. Find all rootiful sets of integers that contain all numbers of the form $2^{a}-2^{b}$ for positive integers $a$ and $b$.\n\nThe final answer is that the set $\\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers is the only such rootiful set.", "informal_proof": "The set $\\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers is clearly rootiful. We shall prove that any rootiful set $S$ containing all the numbers of the form $2^{a}-2^{b}$ for $a, b \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$ must be all of $\\mathbb{Z}$.\n\nFirst, note that $0=2^{1}-2^{1} \\in S$ and $2=2^{2}-2^{1} \\in S$. Now, $-1 \\in S$, since it is a root of $2 x+2$, and $1 \\in S$, since it is a root of $2 x^{2}-x-1$. Also, if $n \\in S$ then $-n$ is a root of $x+n$, so it suffices to prove that all positive integers must be in $S$.\n\nNow, we claim that any positive integer $n$ has a multiple in $S$. Indeed, suppose that $n=2^{\\alpha} \\cdot t$ for $\\alpha \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geqslant 0}$ and $t$ odd. Then $t \\mid 2^{\\phi(t)}-1$, so $n \\mid 2^{\\alpha+\\phi(t)+1}-2^{\\alpha+1}$. Moreover, $2^{\\alpha+\\phi(t)+1}-2^{\\alpha+1} \\in S$, and so $S$ contains a multiple of every positive integer $n$.\n\nWe will now prove by induction that all positive integers are in $S$. Suppose that $0,1, \\ldots, n-$ $1 \\in S$; furthermore, let $N$ be a multiple of $n$ in $S$. Consider the base- $n$ expansion of $N$, say $N=a_{k} n^{k}+a_{k-1} n^{k-1}+\\cdots+a_{1} n+a_{0}$. Since $0 \\leqslant a_{i}<n$ for each $a_{i}$, we have that all the $a_{i}$ are in $S$. Furthermore, $a_{0}=0$ since $N$ is a multiple of $n$. Therefore, $a_{k} n^{k}+a_{k-1} n^{k-1}+\\cdots+a_{1} n-N=0$, so $n$ is a root of a polynomial with coefficients in $S$. This tells us that $n \\in S$, completing the induction."}
