    "informal_proof": "It is no hard to see that the two functions given by $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=-x$ for all real $x$ respectively solve the functional equation. In the sequel, we prove that there are no further solutions.\n\nLet $f$ be a function satisfying the given equation. It is clear that $f$ cannot be a constant. Let us first show that $f(0)=0$. Suppose that $f(0) \\neq 0$. For any real $t$, substituting $(x, y)=\\left(0, \\frac{t}{f(0)}\\right)$ into the given functional equation, we obtain\n\n$$\nf(0)=f(t),\n$$\n\ncontradicting the fact that $f$ is not a constant function. Therefore, $f(0)=0$. Next for any $t$, substituting $(x, y)=(t, 0)$ and $(x, y)=(t,-t)$ into the given equation, we get\n\n$$\nf(t f(t))=f(0)+t^{2}=t^{2},\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nf(t f(0))=f(-t f(t))+t^{2},\n$$\n\nrespectively. Therefore, we conclude that\n\n$$\nf(t f(t))=t^{2}, \\quad f(-t f(t))=-t^{2}, \\quad \\text { for every real } t .\n$$\n\nConsequently, for every real $v$, there exists a real $u$, such that $f(u)=v$. We also see that if $f(t)=0$, then $0=f(t f(t))=t^{2}$ so that $t=0$, and thus 0 is the only real number satisfying $f(t)=0$.\n\nWe next show that for any real number $s$,\n\n$$\nf(-s)=-f(s) .\n$$\n\nThis is clear if $f(s)=0$. Suppose now $f(s)<0$, then we can find a number $t$ for which $f(s)=-t^{2}$. As $t \\neq 0$ implies $f(t) \\neq 0$, we can also find number a such that af $(t)=s$. Substituting $(x, y)=(t, a)$ into the given equation, we get\n\n$$\nf(t f(t+a))=f(a f(t))+t^{2}=f(s)+t^{2}=0,\n$$\n\nand therefore, $t f(t+a)=0$, which implies $t+a=0$, and hence $s=-t f(t)$. Consequently, $f(-s)=f(t f(t))=t^{2}=-\\left(-t^{2}\\right)=-f(s)$ holds in this case.\n\nFinally, suppose $f(s)>0$ holds. Then there exists a real number $t \\neq 0$ for which $f(s)=t^{2}$. Choose a number $a$ such that $t f(a)=s$. Substituting $(x, y)=(t, a-t)$ into the given equation, we get $f(s)=f(t f(a))=f((a-t) f(t))+t^{2}=f((a-t) f(t))+f(s)$. So we have $f((a-t) f(t))=0$, from which we conclude that $(a-t) f(t)=0$. Since $f(t) \\neq 0$, we get $a=t$ so that $s=t f(t)$ and thus we see $f(-s)=f(-t f(t))=-t^{2}=-f(s)$ holds in this case also. This observation finishes the proof of (3).\n\nBy substituting $(x, y)=(s, t),(x, y)=(t,-s-t)$ and $(x, y)=(-s-t, s)$ into the given equation, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{r}\nf(s f(s+t)))=f(t f(s))+s^{2} \\\\\nf(t f(-s))=f((-s-t) f(t))+t^{2}\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nand\n\n$$\nf((-s-t) f(-t))=f(s f(-s-t))+(s+t)^{2},\n$$\n\nrespectively. Using the fact that $f(-x)=-f(x)$ holds for all $x$ to rewrite the second and the third equation, and rearranging the terms, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nf(t f(s))-f(s f(s+t)) & =-s^{2} \\\\\nf(t f(s))-f((s+t) f(t)) & =-t^{2} \\\\\nf((s+t) f(t))+f(s f(s+t)) & =(s+t)^{2} .\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nAdding up these three equations now yields $2 f(t f(s))=2 t s$, and therefore, we conclude that $f(t f(s))=t s$ holds for every pair of real numbers $s, t$. By fixing $s$ so that $f(s)=1$, we obtain $f(x)=s x$. In view of the given equation, we see that $s=\\pm 1$. It is easy to check that both functions $f(x)=x$ and $f(x)=-x$ satisfy the given functional equation, so these are the desired solutions."
