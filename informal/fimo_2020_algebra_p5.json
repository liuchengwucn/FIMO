    "informal_statement": "A magician intends to perform the following trick. She announces a positive integer $n$, along with $2 n$ real numbers $x_{1}<\\ldots<x_{2 n}$, to the audience. A member of the audience then secretly chooses a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ with real coefficients, computes the $2 n$ values $P\\left(x_{1}\\right), \\ldots, P\\left(x_{2 n}\\right)$, and writes down these $2 n$ values on the blackboard in non-decreasing order. After that the magician announces the secret polynomial to the audience.\n\nCan the magician find a strategy to perform such a trick?\n\nThe final answer is that no, she cannot.",
    "informal_proof": "Let $x_{1}<x_{2}<\\ldots<x_{2 n}$ be real numbers chosen by the magician. We will construct two distinct polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$, each of degree $n$, such that the member of audience will write down the same sequence for both polynomials. This will mean that the magician cannot distinguish $P$ from $Q$.\n\nClaim. There exists a polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n$ such that $P\\left(x_{2 i-1}\\right)+P\\left(x_{2 i}\\right)=0$ for $i=$ $1,2, \\ldots, n$.\n\nProof. We want to find a polynomial $a_{n} x^{n}+\\ldots+a_{1} x+a_{0}$ satisfying the following system of equations:\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\n\\left(x_{1}^{n}+x_{2}^{n}\\right) a_{n}+\\left(x_{1}^{n-1}+x_{2}^{n-1}\\right) a_{n-1}+\\ldots+2 a_{0}=0 \\\\\n\\left(x_{3}^{n}+x_{4}^{n}\\right) a_{n}+\\left(x_{3}^{n-1}+x_{4}^{n-1}\\right) a_{n-1}+\\ldots+2 a_{0}=0 \\\\\n\\cdots \\\\\n\\left(x_{2 n-1}^{n}+x_{2 n}^{n}\\right) a_{n}+\\left(x_{2 n-1}^{n-1}+x_{2 n}^{n-1}\\right) a_{n-1}+\\ldots+2 a_{0}=0\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nWe use the well known fact that a homogeneous system of $n$ linear equations in $n+1$ variables has a nonzero solution. (This fact can be proved using induction on $n$, via elimination of variables.) Applying this fact to the above system, we find a nonzero polynomial $P(x)$ of degree not exceeding $n$ such that its coefficients $a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ satisfy this system. Therefore $P\\left(x_{2 i-1}\\right)+P\\left(x_{2 i}\\right)=0$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. Notice that $P$ has a root on each segment $\\left[x_{2 i-1}, x_{2 i}\\right]$ by the Intermediate Value theorem, so $n$ roots in total. Since $P$ is nonzero, we get $\\operatorname{deg} P=n$\n\nNow consider a polynomial $P(x)$ provided by the Claim, and take $Q(x)=-P(x)$. The properties of $P(x)$ yield that $P\\left(x_{2 i-1}\\right)=Q\\left(x_{2 i}\\right)$ and $Q\\left(x_{2 i-1}\\right)=P\\left(x_{2 i}\\right)$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, n$. It is also clear that $P \\neq-P=Q$ and $\\operatorname{deg} Q=\\operatorname{deg} P=n$."
