    "informal_proof": "Suppose that function $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ satisfies the problem conditions.\n\nLemma. For any prime $p$ and any $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$, we have $x \\equiv y(\\bmod p)$ if and only if $f(x) \\equiv f(y)$ $(\\bmod p)$. Moreover, $p \\mid f(x)$ if and only if $p \\mid x$.\n\nProof. Consider an arbitrary prime $p$. Since $f$ is surjective, there exists some $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $p \\mid f(x)$. Let\n\n$$\nd=\\min \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}: p \\mid f(x)\\} .\n$$\n\nBy induction on $k$, we obtain that $p \\mid f(k d)$ for all $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. The base is true since $p \\mid f(d)$. Moreover, if $p \\mid f(k d)$ and $p \\mid f(d)$ then, by the problem condition, $p \\mid f(k d+d)=f((k+1) d)$ as required.\n\nSuppose that there exists an $x \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $d \\nmid x$ but $p \\mid f(x)$. Let\n\n$$\ny=\\min \\{x \\in \\mathbb{N}: d \\backslash x, p \\mid f(x)\\} .\n$$\n\nBy the choice of $d$, we have $y>d$, and $y-d$ is a positive integer not divisible by $d$. Then $p \\nmid f(y-d)$, while $p \\mid f(d)$ and $p \\mid f(d+(y-d))=f(y)$. This contradicts the problem condition. Hence, there is no such $x$, and\n\n$$\np|f(x) \\Longleftrightarrow d| x .\n$$\n\nTake arbitrary $x, y \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $x \\equiv y(\\bmod d)$. We have $p \\mid f(x+(2 x d-x))=f(2 x d)$; moreover, since $d \\mid 2 x d+(y-x)=y+(2 x d-x)$, we get $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$. Then by the problem condition $p|f(x)+f(2 x d-x), p| f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$, and hence $f(x) \\equiv-f(2 x d-x) \\equiv f(y)$ $(\\bmod p)$\n\nOn the other hand, assume that $f(x) \\equiv f(y)(\\bmod p)$. Again we have $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)$ which by our assumption implies that $p \\mid f(x)+f(2 x d-x)+(f(y)-f(x))=f(y)+f(2 x d-x)$. Hence by the problem condition $p \\mid f(y+(2 x d-x))$. Using (1) we get $0 \\equiv y+(2 x d-x) \\equiv y-x$ $(\\bmod d)$\n\nThus, we have proved that\n\n$$\nx \\equiv y \\quad(\\bmod d) \\Longleftrightarrow f(x) \\equiv f(y) \\quad(\\bmod p) .\n$$\n\nWe are left to show that $p=d$ : in this case (1) and (2) provide the desired statements.\n\nThe numbers $1,2, \\ldots, d$ have distinct residues modulo $d$. By $(2)$, numbers $f(1), f(2), \\ldots$, $f(d)$ have distinct residues modulo $p$; hence there are at least $d$ distinct residues, and $p \\geq d$. On the other hand, by the surjectivity of $f$, there exist $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{p} \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f\\left(x_{i}\\right)=i$ for any $i=1,2, \\ldots, p$. By $(2)$, all these $x_{i}$ 's have distinct residues modulo $d$. For the same reasons, $d \\geq p$. Hence, $d=p$.\n\nNow we prove that $f(n)=n$ by induction on $n$. If $n=1$ then, by the Lemma, $p \\nmid f(1)$ for any prime $p$, so $f(1)=1$, and the base is established. Suppose that $n>1$ and denote $k=f(n)$. Note that there exists a prime $q \\mid n$, so by the Lemma $q \\mid k$ and $k>1$.\n\nIf $k>n$ then $k-n+1>1$, and there exists a prime $p \\mid k-n+1$; we have $k \\equiv n-1$ $(\\bmod p)$. By the induction hypothesis we have $f(n-1)=n-1 \\equiv k=f(n)(\\bmod p)$. Now, by the Lemma we obtain $n-1 \\equiv n(\\bmod p)$ which cannot be true. Analogously, if $k<n$, then $f(k-1)=k-1$ by induction hypothesis. Moreover, $n-k+1>1$, so there exists a prime $p \\mid n-k+1$ and $n \\equiv k-1(\\bmod p)$. By the Lemma again, $k=f(n) \\equiv$ $f(k-1)=k-1(\\bmod p)$, which is also false. The only remaining case is $k=n$, so $f(n)=n$.\n\nFinally, the function $f(n)=n$ obviously satisfies the condition."
