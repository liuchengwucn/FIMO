    "informal_statement": "Prove that, for every positive integer $n$, there exists an integer $m$ such that $2^{m}+m$ is divisible by $n$.",
    "informal_proof": "We will prove by induction on $d$ that, for every positive integer $N$, there exist positive integers $b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{d-1}$ such that, for each $i=0,1,2, \\ldots, d-1$, we have $b_{i}>N$ and\n\n$$\n2^{b_{i}}+b_{i} \\equiv i \\quad(\\bmod d)\n$$\n\nThis yields the claim for $m=b_{0}$.\n\nThe base case $d=1$ is trivial. Take an $a>1$ and assume that the statement holds for all $d<a$. Note that the remainders of $2^{i}$ modulo a repeat periodically starting with some exponent $M$. Let $k$ be the length of the period; this means that $2^{M+k^{\\prime}} \\equiv 2^{M}(\\bmod a)$ holds only for those $k^{\\prime}$ which are multiples of $k$. Note further that the period cannot contain all the $a$ remainders, since 0 either is missing or is the only number in the period. Thus $k<a$.\n\nLet $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(a, k)$ and let $a^{\\prime}=a / d, k^{\\prime}=k / d$. Since $0<k<a$, we also have $0<d<a$. By the induction hypothesis, there exist positive integers $b_{0}, b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{d-1}$ such that $b_{i}>\\max \\left(2^{M}, N\\right)$ and\n\n$$\n2^{b_{i}}+b_{i} \\equiv i \\quad(\\bmod d) \\quad \\text { for } \\quad i=0,1,2, \\ldots, d-1 .\n$$\n\nFor each $i=0,1, \\ldots, d-1$ consider the sequence\n\n$$\n2^{b_{i}}+b_{i}, \\quad 2^{b_{i}+k}+\\left(b_{i}+k\\right), \\ldots, \\quad 2^{b_{i}+\\left(a^{\\prime}-1\\right) k}+\\left(b_{i}+\\left(a^{\\prime}-1\\right) k\\right) .\n$$\n\nModulo $a$, these numbers are congruent to\n\n$$\n2^{b_{i}}+b_{i}, \\quad 2^{b_{i}}+\\left(b_{i}+k\\right), \\quad \\ldots, \\quad 2^{b_{i}}+\\left(b_{i}+\\left(a^{\\prime}-1\\right) k\\right),\n$$\n\nrespectively. The $d$ sequences contain $a^{\\prime} d=a$ numbers altogether. We shall now prove that no two of these numbers are congruent modulo $a$.\n\nSuppose that\n\n$$\n2^{b_{i}}+\\left(b_{i}+m k\\right) \\equiv 2^{b_{j}}+\\left(b_{j}+n k\\right) \\quad(\\bmod a)\n$$\n\nfor some values of $i, j \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, d-1\\}$ and $m, n \\in\\left\\{0,1, \\ldots, a^{\\prime}-1\\right\\}$. Since $d$ is a divisor of $a$, we also have\n\n$$\n2^{b_{i}}+\\left(b_{i}+m k\\right) \\equiv 2^{b_{j}}+\\left(b_{j}+n k\\right) \\quad(\\bmod d) .\n$$\n\nBecause $d$ is a divisor of $k$ and in view of $(1)$, we obtain $i \\equiv j(\\bmod d)$. As $i, j \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, d-1\\}$, this just means that $i=j$. Substituting this into (3) yields $m k \\equiv n k(\\bmod a)$. Therefore $m k^{\\prime} \\equiv n k^{\\prime}\\left(\\bmod a^{\\prime}\\right) ;$ and since $a^{\\prime}$ and $k^{\\prime}$ are coprime, we get $m \\equiv n\\left(\\bmod a^{\\prime}\\right)$. Hence also $m=n$.\n\nIt follows that the $a$ numbers that make up the $d$ sequences (2) satisfy all the requirements; they are certainly all greater than $N$ because we chose each $b_{i}>\\max \\left(2^{M}, N\\right)$. So the statement holds for $a$, completing the induction."
