{"problem_name": "imosl_2020_number_theory_p4_1", "informal_statement": "For any odd prime $p$ and any integer $n$, let $d_{p}(n) \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$ denote the remainder when $n$ is divided by $p$. We say that $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$ is a $p$-sequence, if $a_{0}$ is a positive integer coprime to $p$, and $a_{n+1}=a_{n}+d_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ for $n \\geqslant 0$.\n\nDo there exist infinitely many primes $p$ for which there exist $p$-sequences $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$ and $\\left(b_{0}, b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$ such that $a_{n}>b_{n}$ for infinitely many $n$, and $b_{n}>a_{n}$ for infinitely many $n$ ?\n\nThe final answer is yes.", "informal_proof": "Fix some odd prime $p$, and let $T$ be the smallest positive integer such that $p \\mid 2^{T}-1$; in other words, $T$ is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo $p$.\n\nConsider any $p$-sequence $\\left(x_{n}\\right)=\\left(x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$. Obviously, $x_{n+1} \\equiv 2 x_{n}(\\bmod p)$ and therefore $x_{n} \\equiv 2^{n} x_{0}(\\bmod p)$. This yields $x_{n+T} \\equiv x_{n}(\\bmod p)$ and therefore $d\\left(x_{n+T}\\right)=d\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ for all $n \\geqslant 0$. It follows that the sum $d\\left(x_{n}\\right)+d\\left(x_{n+1}\\right)+\\ldots+d\\left(x_{n+T-1}\\right)$ does not depend on $n$ and is thus a function of $x_{0}$ (and $p$ ) only; we shall denote this sum by $S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$, and extend the function $S_{p}(\\cdot)$ to all (not necessarily positive) integers. Therefore, we have $x_{n+k T}=x_{n}+k S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$ for all positive integers $n$ and $k$. Clearly, $S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)=S_{p}\\left(2^{t} x_{0}\\right)$ for every integer $t \\geqslant 0$.\n\nIn both parts, we use the notation\n\n$$\nS_{p}^{+}=S_{p}(1)=\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} d_{p}\\left(2^{i}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad S_{p}^{-}=S_{p}(-1)=\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} d_{p}\\left(p-2^{i}\\right) .\n$$\n\nLet $q>3$ be a prime and $p$ a prime divisor of $2^{q}+1$ that is greater than 3 . We will show that $p$ is suitable for part (a). Notice that $9 \\nmid 2^{q}+1$, so that such a $p$ exists. Moreover, for any two odd primes $q<r$ we have $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(2^{q}+1,2^{r}+1\\right)=2^{\\operatorname{gcd}(q, r)}+1=3$, thus there exist infinitely many such primes $p$.\n\nFor the chosen $p$, we have $T=2 q$. Since $2^{q} \\equiv-1(\\bmod p)$, we have $S_{p}^{+}=S_{p}^{-}$. Now consider the $p$-sequences $\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ and $\\left(b_{n}\\right)$ with $a_{0}=p+1$ and $b_{0}=p-1$; we claim that these sequences satisfy the required conditions. We have $a_{0}>b_{0}$ and $a_{1}=p+2<b_{1}=2 p-2$. It follows then that\n\n$$\na_{k \\cdot 2 q}=a_{0}+k S_{p}^{+}>b_{0}+k S_{p}^{+}=b_{k \\cdot 2 q} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad a_{k \\cdot 2 q+1}=a_{1}+k S_{p}^{+}<b_{1}+k S_{p}^{+}=b_{k \\cdot 2 q+1}\n$$\n\nfor all $k=0,1, \\ldots$, as desired."}
