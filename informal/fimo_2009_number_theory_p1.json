    "informal_statement": "A social club has $n$ members. They have the membership numbers $1,2, \\ldots, n$, respectively. From time to time members send presents to other members, including items they have already received as presents from other members. In order to avoid the embarrassing situation that a member might receive a present that he or she has sent to other members, the club adds the following rule to its statutes at one of its annual general meetings:\n\n\"A member with membership number $a$ is permitted to send a present to a member with membership number $b$ if and only if $a(b-1)$ is a multiple of $n . \"$\n\nProve that, if each member follows this rule, none will receive a present from another member that he or she has already sent to other members.\n\nAlternative formulation: Let $G$ be a directed graph with $n$ vertices $v_{1}, v_{2}, \\ldots, v_{n}$, such that there is an edge going from $v_{a}$ to $v_{b}$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are distinct and $a(b-1)$ is a multiple of $n$. Prove that this graph does not contain a directed cycle.",
    "informal_proof": "Suppose there is an edge from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$. Then $i(j-1)=i j-i=k n$ for some integer $k$, which implies $i=i j-k n$. If $\\operatorname{gcd}(i, n)=d$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(j, n)=e$, then $e$ divides $i j-k n=i$ and thus $e$ also divides $d$. Hence, if there is an edge from $v_{i}$ to $v_{j}$, then $\\operatorname{gcd}(j, n) \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}(i, n)$.\n\nIf there is a cycle in $G$, say $v_{i_{1}} \\rightarrow v_{i_{2}} \\rightarrow \\cdots \\rightarrow v_{i_{r}} \\rightarrow v_{i_{1}}$, then we have\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(i_{1}, n\\right)\\left|\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(i_{r}, n\\right)\\right| \\operatorname{gcd}\\left(i_{r-1}, n\\right)|\\ldots| \\operatorname{gcd}\\left(i_{2}, n\\right) \\mid \\operatorname{gcd}\\left(i_{1}, n\\right)\n$$\n\nwhich implies that all these greatest common divisors must be equal, say be equal to $t$.\n\nNow we pick any of the $i_{k}$, without loss of generality let it be $i_{1}$. Then $i_{r}\\left(i_{1}-1\\right)$ is a multiple of $n$ and hence also (by dividing by $t$ ), $i_{1}-1$ is a multiple of $\\frac{n}{t}$. Since $i_{1}$ and $i_{1}-1$ are relatively prime, also $t$ and $\\frac{n}{t}$ are relatively prime. So, by the Chinese remainder theorem, the value of $i_{1}$ is uniquely determined modulo $n=t \\cdot \\frac{n}{t}$ by the value of $t$. But, as $i_{1}$ was chosen arbitrarily among the $i_{k}$, this implies that all the $i_{k}$ have to be equal, a contradiction."
