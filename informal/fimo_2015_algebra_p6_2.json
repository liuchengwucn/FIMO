    "informal_proof": "For convenience, we set $k=2015=2 \\ell+1$.\n\nFor every polynomial $F(x)$ and every nonnegative integer $m$, define $\\Sigma_{F}(m)=$ $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} F(i)$; in particular, $\\Sigma_{F}(0)=0$. It is well-known that for every nonnegative integer $d$ the sum $\\sum_{i=1}^{m} i^{d}$ is a polynomial in $m$ of degree $d+1$. Thus $\\Sigma_{F}$ may also be regarded as a real polynomial of degree $\\operatorname{deg} F+1$ (with the exception that if $F=0$, then $\\Sigma_{F}=0$ as well). This allows us to consider the values of $\\Sigma_{F}$ at all real points (where the initial definition does not apply).\n\nAssume for the sake of contradiction that there exist two distinct block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ of degree $n$. Then both polynomials $\\Sigma_{P-Q}(x)$ and $\\Sigma_{P^{2}-Q^{2}}(x)$ have roots at the points $0, k, 2 k, \\ldots, n k$. This motivates the following lemma, where we use the special polynomial\n\n$$\nT(x)=\\prod_{i=0}^{n}(x-i k)\n$$\n\nLemma. Assume that $F(x)$ is a nonzero polynomial such that $0, k, 2 k, \\ldots, n k$ are among the roots of the polynomial $\\Sigma_{F}(x)$. Then $\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant n$, and there exists a polynomial $G(x)$ such that $\\operatorname{deg} G=\\operatorname{deg} F-n$ and $F(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)$.\n\nProof. If $\\operatorname{deg} F<n$, then $\\Sigma_{F}(x)$ has at least $n+1$ roots, while its degree is less than $n+1$. Therefore, $\\Sigma_{F}(x)=0$ and hence $F(x)=0$, which is impossible. Thus $\\operatorname{deg} F \\geqslant n$.\n\nThe lemma condition yields that $\\Sigma_{F}(x)=T(x) G(x)$ for some polynomial $G(x)$ such that $\\operatorname{deg} G=\\operatorname{deg} \\Sigma_{F}-(n+1)=\\operatorname{deg} F-n$.\n\nNow, let us define $F_{1}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)$. Then for every positive integer $n$ we have\n\n$$\n\\Sigma_{F_{1}}(n)=\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1))=T(n) G(n)-T(0) G(0)=T(n) G(n)=\\Sigma_{F}(n),\n$$\n\nso the polynomial $\\Sigma_{F-F_{1}}(x)=\\Sigma_{F}(x)-\\Sigma_{F_{1}}(x)$ has infinitely many roots. This means that this polynomial is zero, which in turn yields $F(x)=F_{1}(x)$, as required. First, we apply the lemma to the nonzero polynomial $R_{1}(x)=P(x)-Q(x)$. Since the degree of $R_{1}(x)$ is at most $n$, we conclude that it is exactly $n$. Moreover, $R_{1}(x)=\\alpha \\cdot(T(x)-T(x-1))$ for some nonzero constant $\\alpha$.\n\nOur next aim is to prove that the polynomial $S(x)=P(x)+Q(x)$ is constant. Assume the contrary. Then, notice that the polynomial $R_{2}(x)=P(x)^{2}-Q(x)^{2}=R_{1}(x) S(x)$ is also nonzero and satisfies the lemma condition. Since $n<\\operatorname{deg} R_{1}+\\operatorname{deg} S=\\operatorname{deg} R_{2} \\leqslant 2 n$, the lemma yields\n\n$$\nR_{2}(x)=T(x) G(x)-T(x-1) G(x-1)\n$$\n\nwith some polynomial $G(x)$ with $0<\\operatorname{deg} G \\leqslant n$.\n\nSince the polynomial $R_{1}(x)=\\alpha(T(x)-T(x-1))$ divides the polynomial\n\n$$\nR_{2}(x)=T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))+G(x-1)(T(x)-T(x-1)),\n$$\n\nwe get $R_{1}(x) \\mid T(x)(G(x)-G(x-1))$. On the other hand,\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(T(x), R_{1}(x)\\right)=\\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x)-T(x-1))=\\operatorname{gcd}(T(x), T(x-1))=1,\n$$\n\nsince both $T(x)$ and $T(x-1)$ are the products of linear polynomials, and their roots are distinct. Thus $R_{1}(x) \\mid G(x)-G(x-1)$. However, this is impossible since $G(x)-G(x-1)$ is a nonzero polynomial of degree less than $n=\\operatorname{deg} R_{1}$.\n\nThus, our assumption is wrong, and $S(x)$ is a constant polynomial, say $S(x)=\\beta$. Notice that the polynomials $(2 P(x)-\\beta) / \\alpha$ and $(2 Q(x)-\\beta) / \\alpha$ are also block-similar and distinct. So we may replace the initial polynomials by these ones, thus obtaining two block-similar polynomials $P(x)$ and $Q(x)$ with $P(x)=-Q(x)=T(x)-T(x-1)$. It remains to show that this is impossible.\n\nFor every $i=1,2 \\ldots, n$, the values $T(i k-k+1)$ and $T(i k-1)$ have the same sign. This means that the values $P(i k-k+1)=T(i k-k+1)$ and $P(i k)=-T(i k-1)$ have opposite signs, so $P(x)$ has a root in each of the $n$ segments $[i k-k+1, i k]$. Since $\\operatorname{deg} P=n$, it must have exactly one root in each of them.\n\nThus, the sequence $P(1), P(2), \\ldots, P(k)$ should change sign exactly once. On the other hand, since $P(x)$ and $-P(x)$ are block-similar, this sequence must have as many positive terms as negative ones. Since $k=2 \\ell+1$ is odd, this shows that the middle term of the sequence above must be zero, so $P(\\ell+1)=0$, or $T(\\ell+1)=T(\\ell)$. However, this is not true since\n\n$$\n|T(\\ell+1)|=|\\ell+1| \\cdot|\\ell| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|\\ell+1-i k|<|\\ell| \\cdot|\\ell+1| \\cdot \\prod_{i=2}^{n}|\\ell-i k|=|T(\\ell)|,\n$$\n\nwhere the strict inequality holds because $n \\geqslant 2$. We come to the final contradiction."
