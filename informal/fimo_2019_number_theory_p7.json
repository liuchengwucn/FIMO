    "informal_statement": "Prove that there is a constant $c>0$ and infinitely many positive integers $n$ with the following property: there are infinitely many positive integers that cannot be expressed as the sum of fewer than $c n \\log (n)$ pairwise coprime $n^{\\text {th }}$ powers.",
    "informal_proof": "Suppose, for an integer $n$, that we can find another integer $N$ satisfying the following property:\n\n$$\nn \\text { is divisible by } \\varphi\\left(p^{e}\\right) \\text { for every prime power } p^{e} \\text { exactly dividing } N \\text {. }\n$$\n\nThis property ensures that all $n^{\\text {th }}$ powers are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo each such prime power $p^{e}$, and hence that any sum of $m$ pairwise coprime $n^{\\text {th }}$ powers is congruent to $m$ or $m-1$ modulo $p^{e}$, since at most one of the $n^{\\text {th }}$ powers is divisible by $p$. Thus, if $k$ denotes the number of distinct prime factors of $N$, we find by the Chinese Remainder Theorem at most $2^{k} m$ residue classes modulo $N$ which are sums of at most $m$ pairwise coprime $n^{\\text {th }}$ powers. In particular, if $N>2^{k} m$ then there are infinitely many positive integers not expressible as a sum of at most $m$ pairwise coprime $n^{\\text {th }}$ powers.\n\nIt thus suffices to prove that there are arbitrarily large pairs $(n, N)$ of integers satisfying ( $\\dagger)$ such that\n\n$$\nN>c \\cdot 2^{k} n \\log (n)\n$$\n\nfor some positive constant $c$.\n\nWe construct such pairs as follows. Fix a positive integer $t$ and choose (distinct) prime numbers $p \\mid 2^{2^{t-1}}+1$ and $q \\mid 2^{2^{t}}+1$; we set $N=p q$. It is well-known that $2^{t} \\mid p-1$ and $2^{t+1} \\mid q-1$, hence\n\n$$\nn=\\frac{(p-1)(q-1)}{2^{t}}\n$$\n\nis an integer and the pair $(n, N)$ satisfies $(\\dagger)$.\n\nEstimating the size of $N$ and $n$ is now straightforward. We have\n\n$$\n\\log _{2}(n) \\leqslant 2^{t-1}+2^{t}-t<2^{t+1}<2 \\cdot \\frac{N}{n}\n$$\n\nwhich rearranges to\n\n$$\nN>\\frac{1}{8} \\cdot 2^{2} n \\log _{2}(n)\n$$\n\nand so we are done if we choose $c<\\frac{1}{8 \\log (2)} \\approx 0.18$."
