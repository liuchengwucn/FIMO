    "informal_statement": "Let $n \\geqslant 2018$ be an integer, and let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}, b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}$ be pairwise distinct positive integers not exceeding $5 n$. Suppose that the sequence\n\n$$\n\\frac{a_{1}}{b_{1}}, \\frac{a_{2}}{b_{2}}, \\ldots, \\frac{a_{n}}{b_{n}}\n$$\n\nforms an arithmetic progression. Prove that the terms of the sequence are equal.",
    "informal_proof": "Suppose that (1) is an arithmetic progression with nonzero difference. Let the difference be $\\Delta=\\frac{c}{d}$, where $d>0$ and $c, d$ are coprime.\n\nWe will show that too many denominators $b_{i}$ should be divisible by $d$. To this end, for any $1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n$ and any prime divisor $p$ of $d$, say that the index $i$ is $p$-wrong, if $v_{p}\\left(b_{i}\\right)<v_{p}(d) .\\left(v_{p}(x)\\right.$ stands for the exponent of $p$ in the prime factorisation of $x$.)\n\nClaim 1. For any prime $p$, all $p$-wrong indices are congruent modulo $p$. In other words, the $p$-wrong indices (if they exist) are included in an arithmetic progression with difference $p$.\n\nProof. Let $\\alpha=v_{p}(d)$. For the sake of contradiction, suppose that $i$ and $j$ are $p$-wrong indices (i.e., none of $b_{i}$ and $b_{j}$ is divisible by $\\left.p^{\\alpha}\\right)$ such that $i \\not \\equiv j(\\bmod p)$. Then the least common denominator of $\\frac{a_{i}}{b_{i}}$ and $\\frac{a_{j}}{b_{j}}$ is not divisible by $p^{\\alpha}$. But this is impossible because in their difference, $(i-j) \\Delta=\\frac{(i-j) c}{d}$, the numerator is coprime to $p$, but $p^{\\alpha}$ divides the denominator $d$.\n\nClaim 2. $d$ has no prime divisors greater than 5.\n\nProof. Suppose that $p \\geqslant 7$ is a prime divisor of $d$. Among the indices $1,2, \\ldots, n$, at most $\\left\\lceil\\frac{n}{p}\\right\\rceil<\\frac{n}{p}+1$ are $p$-wrong, so $p$ divides at least $\\frac{p-1}{p} n-1$ of $b_{1}, \\ldots, b_{n}$. Since these denominators are distinct,\n\n$$\n5 n \\geqslant \\max \\left\\{b_{i}: p \\mid b_{i}\\right\\} \\geqslant\\left(\\frac{p-1}{p} n-1\\right) p=(p-1)(n-1)-1 \\geqslant 6(n-1)-1>5 n,\n$$\n\na contradiction.\n\nClaim 3. For every $0 \\leqslant k \\leqslant n-30$, among the denominators $b_{k+1}, b_{k+2}, \\ldots, b_{k+30}$, at least $\\varphi(30)=8$ are divisible by $d$.\n\nProof. By Claim 1, the 2-wrong, 3-wrong and 5-wrong indices can be covered by three arithmetic progressions with differences 2,3 and 5 . By a simple inclusion-exclusion, $(2-1) \\cdot(3-1) \\cdot(5-1)=8$ indices are not covered; by Claim 2, we have $d \\mid b_{i}$ for every uncovered index $i$.\n\nClaim 4. $|\\Delta|<\\frac{20}{n-2}$ and $d>\\frac{n-2}{20}$.\n\nProof. From the sequence (1), remove all fractions with $b_{n}<\\frac{n}{2}$, There remain at least $\\frac{n}{2}$ fractions, and they cannot exceed $\\frac{5 n}{n / 2}=10$. So we have at least $\\frac{n}{2}$ elements of the arithmetic progression (1) in the interval $(0,10]$, hence the difference must be below $\\frac{10}{n / 2-1}=\\frac{20}{n-2}$.\n\nThe second inequality follows from $\\frac{1}{d} \\leqslant \\frac{|c|}{d}=|\\Delta|$.\n\nNow we have everything to get the final contradiction. By Claim 3, we have $d \\mid b_{i}$ for at least $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{30}\\right\\rfloor \\cdot 8$ indices $i$. By Claim 4, we have $d \\geqslant \\frac{n-2}{20}$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n5 n \\geqslant \\max \\left\\{b_{i}: d \\mid b_{i}\\right\\} \\geqslant\\left(\\left\\lfloor\\frac{n}{30}\\right\\rfloor \\cdot 8\\right) \\cdot d>\\left(\\frac{n}{30}-1\\right) \\cdot 8 \\cdot \\frac{n-2}{20}>5 n .\n$$"
