{"problem_name": "imosl_2016_number_theory_p1", "informal_statement": "For any positive integer $k$, denote the sum of digits of $k$ in its decimal representation by $S(k)$. Find all polynomials $P(x)$ with integer coefficients such that for any positive integer $n \\geqslant 2016$, the integer $P(n)$ is positive and\n\n$$\nS(P(n))=P(S(n))\n$$\n\nThe final answer is\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item $P(x)=c$ where $1 \\leqslant c \\leqslant 9$ is an integer; or\n\n  \\item $P(x)=x$.\n\n\\end{itemize}", "informal_proof": "We consider three cases according to the degree of $P$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Case 1. $P(x)$ is a constant polynomial.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nLet $P(x)=c$ where $c$ is an integer constant. Then (1) becomes $S(c)=c$. This holds if and only if $1 \\leqslant c \\leqslant 9$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Case 2. $\\operatorname{deg} P=1$.\n\\end{itemize}\n\nWe have the following observation. For any positive integers $m, n$, we have\n\n$$\nS(m+n) \\leqslant S(m)+S(n)\n$$\n\nand equality holds if and only if there is no carry in the addition $m+n$.\n\nLet $P(x)=a x+b$ for some integers $a, b$ where $a \\neq 0$. As $P(n)$ is positive for large $n$, we must have $a \\geqslant 1$. The condition (1) becomes $S(a n+b)=a S(n)+b$ for all $n \\geqslant 2016$. Setting $n=2025$ and $n=2020$ respectively, we get\n\n$$\nS(2025 a+b)-S(2020 a+b)=(a S(2025)+b)-(a S(2020)+b)=5 a .\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, (2) implies\n\n$$\nS(2025 a+b)=S((2020 a+b)+5 a) \\leqslant S(2020 a+b)+S(5 a)\n$$\n\nThese give $5 a \\leqslant S(5 a)$. As $a \\geqslant 1$, this holds only when $a=1$, in which case (1) reduces to $S(n+b)=S(n)+b$ for all $n \\geqslant 2016$. Then we find that\n\n$$\nS(n+1+b)-S(n+b)=(S(n+1)+b)-(S(n)+b)=S(n+1)-S(n) .\n$$\n\nIf $b>0$, we choose $n$ such that $n+1+b=10^{k}$ for some sufficiently large $k$. Note that all the digits of $n+b$ are 9's, so that the left-hand side of (3) equals $1-9 k$. As $n$ is a positive integer less than $10^{k}-1$, we have $S(n)<9 k$. Therefore, the right-hand side of (3) is at least $1-(9 k-1)=2-9 k$, which is a contradiction.\n\nThe case $b<0$ can be handled similarly by considering $n+1$ to be a large power of 10 . Therefore, we conclude that $P(x)=x$, in which case (1) is trivially satisfied. - Case 3. $\\operatorname{deg} P \\geqslant 2$\n\nSuppose the leading term of $P$ is $a_{d} n^{d}$ where $a_{d} \\neq 0$. Clearly, we have $a_{d}>0$. Consider $n=10^{k}-1$ in (1). We get $S(P(n))=P(9 k)$. Note that $P(n)$ grows asymptotically as fast as $n^{d}$, so $S(P(n))$ grows asymptotically as no faster than a constant multiple of $k$. On the other hand, $P(9 k)$ grows asymptotically as fast as $k^{d}$. This shows the two sides of the last equation cannot be equal for sufficiently large $k$ since $d \\geqslant 2$.\n\nTherefore, we conclude that $P(x)=c$ where $1 \\leqslant c \\leqslant 9$ is an integer, or $P(x)=x$."}
