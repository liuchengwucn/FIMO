{"problem_name": "imosl_2009_number_theory_p3", "informal_statement": "Let $f$ be a non-constant function from the set of positive integers into the set of positive integers, such that $a-b$ divides $f(a)-f(b)$ for all distinct positive integers $a, b$. Prove that there exist infinitely many primes $p$ such that $p$ divides $f(c)$ for some positive integer $c$.", "informal_proof": "Denote by $v_{p}(a)$ the exponent of the prime $p$ in the prime decomposition of $a$.\n\nAssume that there are only finitely many primes $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{m}$ that divide some function value produced of $f$.\n\nThere are infinitely many positive integers $a$ such that $v_{p_{i}}(a)>v_{p_{i}}(f(1))$ for all $i=1,2, \\ldots, m$, e.g. $a=\\left(p_{1} p_{2} \\ldots p_{m}\\right)^{\\alpha}$ with $\\alpha$ sufficiently large. Pick any such $a$. The condition of the problem then yields $a \\mid(f(a+1)-f(1))$. Assume $f(a+1) \\neq f(1)$. Then we must have $v_{p_{i}}(f(a+1)) \\neq$ $v_{p_{i}}(f(1))$ for at least one $i$. This yields $v_{p_{i}}(f(a+1)-f(1))=\\min \\left\\{v_{p_{i}}(f(a+1)), v_{p_{i}}(f(1))\\right\\} \\leq$ $v_{p_{1}}(f(1))<v_{p_{i}}(a)$. But this contradicts the fact that $a \\mid(f(a+1)-f(1))$.\n\nHence we must have $f(a+1)=f(1)$ for all such $a$.\n\nNow, for any positive integer $b$ and all such $a$, we have $(a+1-b) \\mid(f(a+1)-f(b))$, i.e., $(a+1-b) \\mid(f(1)-f(b))$. Since this is true for infinitely many positive integers $a$ we must have $f(b)=f(1)$. Hence $f$ is a constant function, a contradiction. Therefore, our initial assumption was false and there are indeed infinitely many primes $p$ dividing $f(c)$ for some positive integer $c$."}
