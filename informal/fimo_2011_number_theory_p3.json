    "informal_statement": "Let $n \\geq 1$ be an odd integer. Determine all functions $f$ from the set of integers to itself such that for all integers $x$ and $y$ the difference $f(x)-f(y)$ divides $x^{n}-y^{n}$.\n\nThe final answers are all functions $f$ of the form $f(x)=\\varepsilon x^{d}+c$, where $\\varepsilon$ is in $\\{1,-1\\}$, the integer $d$ is a positive divisor of $n$, and $c$ is an integer.",
    "informal_proof": "Obviously, all functions in the answer satisfy the condition of the problem. We will show that there are no other functions satisfying that condition.\n\nLet $f$ be a function satisfying the given condition. For each integer $n$, the function $g$ defined by $g(x)=f(x)+n$ also satisfies the same condition. Therefore, by subtracting $f(0)$ from $f(x)$ we may assume that $f(0)=0$.\n\nFor any prime $p$, the condition on $f$ with $(x, y)=(p, 0)$ states that $f(p)$ divides $p^{n}$. Since the set of primes is infinite, there exist integers $d$ and $\\varepsilon$ with $0 \\leq d \\leq n$ and $\\varepsilon \\in\\{1,-1\\}$ such that for infinitely many primes $p$ we have $f(p)=\\varepsilon p^{d}$. Denote the set of these primes by $P$. Since a function $g$ satisfies the given condition if and only if $-g$ satisfies the same condition, we may $\\operatorname{suppose} \\varepsilon=1$\n\nThe case $d=0$ is easily ruled out, because 0 does not divide any nonzero integer. Suppose $d \\geq 1$ and write $n$ as $m d+r$, where $m$ and $r$ are integers such that $m \\geq 1$ and $0 \\leq r \\leq d-1$. Let $x$ be an arbitrary integer. For each prime $p$ in $P$, the difference $f(p)-f(x)$ divides $p^{n}-x^{n}$. Using the equality $f(p)=p^{d}$, we get\n\n$$\np^{n}-x^{n}=p^{r}\\left(p^{d}\\right)^{m}-x^{n} \\equiv p^{r} f(x)^{m}-x^{n} \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod p^{d}-f(x)\\right)\n$$\n\nSince we have $r<d$, for large enough primes $p \\in P$ we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left|p^{r} f(x)^{m}-x^{n}\\right|<p^{d}-f(x) .\n$$\n\nHence $p^{r} f(x)^{m}-x^{n}$ has to be zero. This implies $r=0$ and $x^{n}=\\left(x^{d}\\right)^{m}=f(x)^{m}$. Since $m$ is odd, we obtain $f(x)=x^{d}$"
