    "informal_statement": "For any odd prime $p$ and any integer $n$, let $d_{p}(n) \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, p-1\\}$ denote the remainder when $n$ is divided by $p$. We say that $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$ is a $p$-sequence, if $a_{0}$ is a positive integer coprime to $p$, and $a_{n+1}=a_{n}+d_{p}\\left(a_{n}\\right)$ for $n \\geqslant 0$.\n\nDo there exist infinitely many primes $p$ for which there exist $p$-sequences $\\left(a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$ and $\\left(b_{0}, b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$ such that $a_{0}<b_{0}$, but $a_{n}>b_{n}$ for all $n \\geqslant 1$ ?\n\nThe final answer is yes.",
    "informal_proof": "Fix some odd prime $p$, and let $T$ be the smallest positive integer such that $p \\mid 2^{T}-1$; in other words, $T$ is the multiplicative order of 2 modulo $p$.\n\nConsider any $p$-sequence $\\left(x_{n}\\right)=\\left(x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots\\right)$. Obviously, $x_{n+1} \\equiv 2 x_{n}(\\bmod p)$ and therefore $x_{n} \\equiv 2^{n} x_{0}(\\bmod p)$. This yields $x_{n+T} \\equiv x_{n}(\\bmod p)$ and therefore $d\\left(x_{n+T}\\right)=d\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ for all $n \\geqslant 0$. It follows that the sum $d\\left(x_{n}\\right)+d\\left(x_{n+1}\\right)+\\ldots+d\\left(x_{n+T-1}\\right)$ does not depend on $n$ and is thus a function of $x_{0}$ (and $p$ ) only; we shall denote this sum by $S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$, and extend the function $S_{p}(\\cdot)$ to all (not necessarily positive) integers. Therefore, we have $x_{n+k T}=x_{n}+k S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)$ for all positive integers $n$ and $k$. Clearly, $S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)=S_{p}\\left(2^{t} x_{0}\\right)$ for every integer $t \\geqslant 0$.\n\nIn both parts, we use the notation\n\n$$\nS_{p}^{+}=S_{p}(1)=\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} d_{p}\\left(2^{i}\\right) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad S_{p}^{-}=S_{p}(-1)=\\sum_{i=0}^{T-1} d_{p}\\left(p-2^{i}\\right) .\n$$\n\nLet $q$ be an odd prime and $p$ a prime divisor of $2^{q}-1$; thus we have $T=q$. We will show that $p$ is suitable for part (b). Notice that the numbers of the form $2^{q}-1$ are pairwise coprime (since $\\operatorname{gcd}\\left(2^{q}-1,2^{r}-1\\right)=2^{\\operatorname{gcd}(q, r)}-1=1$ for any two distinct primes $q$ and $r$ ), thus there exist infinitely many such primes $p$. Notice that $d_{p}(x)+d_{p}(p-x)=p$ for all $x$ with $p \\nmid x$, so that the sum $S_{p}^{+}+S_{p}^{-}=p q$ is odd, which yields $S_{p}^{+}=S_{p}(1) \\neq S_{p}(-1)=S_{p}^{-}$.\n\nAssume that $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ and $\\left(y_{n}\\right)$ are two $p$-sequences with $S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)>S_{p}\\left(y_{0}\\right)$ but $x_{0}<y_{0}$. The first condition yields that\n\n$$\nx_{M q+r}-y_{M q+r}=\\left(x_{r}-y_{r}\\right)+M\\left(S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)-S_{p}\\left(y_{0}\\right)\\right) \\geqslant\\left(x_{r}-y_{r}\\right)+M\n$$\n\nfor all nonnegative integers $M$ and every $r=0,1, \\ldots, q-1$. Thus, we have $x_{n}>y_{n}$ for every $n \\geqslant q+q \\cdot \\max \\left\\{y_{r}-x_{r}: r=0,1, \\ldots, q-1\\right\\}$. Now, since $x_{0}<y_{0}$, there exists the largest $n_{0}$ with $x_{n_{0}}<y_{n_{0}}$. In this case the $p$-sequences $a_{n}=x_{n-n_{0}}$ and $b_{n}=y_{n-n_{0}}$ possess the desired property (notice here that $x_{n} \\neq y_{n}$ for all $n \\geqslant 0$, as otherwise we would have $\\left.S_{p}\\left(x_{0}\\right)=S_{p}\\left(x_{n}\\right)=S_{p}\\left(y_{n}\\right)=S_{p}\\left(y_{0}\\right)\\right)$. It remains to find $p$-sequences $\\left(x_{n}\\right)$ and $\\left(y_{n}\\right)$ satisfying the two conditions. Recall that $S_{p}^{+} \\neq S_{p}^{-}$. Now, if $S_{p}^{+}>S_{p}^{-}$, then we can put $x_{0}=1$ and $y_{0}=p-1$. Otherwise, if $S_{p}^{+}<S_{p}^{-}$, then we put $x_{0}=p-1$ and $y_{0}=p+1$."
