    "informal_statement": "Let $n>1$ be an integer. In the space, consider the set\n\n$$\nS=\\{(x, y, z) \\mid x, y, z \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}, x+y+z>0\\}\n$$\n\nFind the smallest number of planes that jointly contain all $(n+1)^{3}-1$ points of $S$ but none of them passes through the origin.\n\nThe final answer is 3n planes.",
    "informal_proof": "It is easy to find $3 n$ such planes. For example, planes $x=i, y=i$ or $z=i$ $(i=1,2, \\ldots, n)$ cover the set $S$ but none of them contains the origin. Another such collection consists of all planes $x+y+z=k$ for $k=1,2, \\ldots, 3 n$.\n\nWe show that $3 n$ is the smallest possible number.\n\nLemma 1. Consider a nonzero polynomial $P\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ in $k$ variables. Suppose that $P$ vanishes at all points $\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ such that $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and $x_{1}+\\cdots+x_{k}>0$, while $P(0,0, \\ldots, 0) \\neq 0$. Then $\\operatorname{deg} P \\geq k n$.\n\nProof. We use induction on $k$. The base case $k=0$ is clear since $P \\neq 0$. Denote for clarity $y=x_{k}$.\n\nLet $R\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)$ be the residue of $P$ modulo $Q(y)=y(y-1) \\ldots(y-n)$. Polynomial $Q(y)$ vanishes at each $y=0,1, \\ldots, n$, hence $P\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)=R\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)$ for all $x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$. Therefore, $R$ also satisfies the condition of the Lemma; moreover, $\\operatorname{deg}_{y} R \\leq n$. Clearly, $\\operatorname{deg} R \\leq \\operatorname{deg} P$, so it suffices to prove that $\\operatorname{deg} R \\geq n k$.\n\nNow, expand polynomial $R$ in the powers of $y$ :\n\n$$\nR\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)=R_{n}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right) y^{n}+R_{n-1}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right) y^{n-1}+\\cdots+R_{0}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right) .\n$$\n\nWe show that polynomial $R_{n}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right)$ satisfies the condition of the induction hypothesis.\n\nConsider the polynomial $T(y)=R(0, \\ldots, 0, y)$ of degree $\\leq n$. This polynomial has $n$ roots $y=1, \\ldots, n$; on the other hand, $T(y) \\not \\equiv 0$ since $T(0) \\neq 0$. Hence $\\operatorname{deg} T=n$, and its leading coefficient is $R_{n}(0,0, \\ldots, 0) \\neq 0$. In particular, in the case $k=1$ we obtain that coefficient $R_{n}$ is nonzero.\n\nSimilarly, take any numbers $a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1} \\in\\{0,1, \\ldots, n\\}$ with $a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{k-1}>0$. Substituting $x_{i}=a_{i}$ into $R\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}, y\\right)$, we get a polynomial in $y$ which vanishes at all points $y=0, \\ldots, n$ and has degree $\\leq n$. Therefore, this polynomial is null, hence $R_{i}\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}\\right)=0$ for all $i=0,1, \\ldots, n$. In particular, $R_{n}\\left(a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{k-1}\\right)=0$.\n\nThus, the polynomial $R_{n}\\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k-1}\\right)$ satisfies the condition of the induction hypothesis. So, we have $\\operatorname{deg} R_{n} \\geq(k-1) n$ and $\\operatorname{deg} P \\geq \\operatorname{deg} R \\geq \\operatorname{deg} R_{n}+n \\geq k n$.\n\nNow we can finish the solution. Suppose that there are $N$ planes covering all the points of $S$ but not containing the origin. Let their equations be $a_{i} x+b_{i} y+c_{i} z+d_{i}=0$. Consider the polynomial\n\n$$\nP(x, y, z)=\\prod_{i=1}^{N}\\left(a_{i} x+b_{i} y+c_{i} z+d_{i}\\right) .\n$$\n\nIt has total degree $N$. This polynomial has the property that $P\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\\right)=0$ for any $\\left(x_{0}, y_{0}, z_{0}\\right) \\in S$, while $P(0,0,0) \\neq 0$. Hence by Lemma 1 we get $N=\\operatorname{deg} P \\geq 3 n$, as desired."
