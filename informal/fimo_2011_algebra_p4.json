    "informal_statement": "Determine all pairs $(f, g)$ of functions from the set of positive integers to itself that satisfy\n\n$$\nf^{g(n)+1}(n)+g^{f(n)}(n)=f(n+1)-g(n+1)+1\n$$\n\nfor every positive integer $n$. Here, $f^{k}(n)$ means $\\underbrace{f(f(\\ldots f}_{k}(n) \\ldots))$.\n\nThe final answer is that the only pair $(f, g)$ of functions that satisfies the equation is given by $f(n)=n$ and $g(n)=1$ for all $n$.",
    "informal_proof": "The given relation implies\n\n$$\nf\\left(f^{g(n)}(n)\\right)<f(n+1) \\quad \\text { for all } n\n$$\n\nwhich will turn out to be sufficient to determine $f$.\n\nLet $y_{1}<y_{2}<\\ldots$ be all the values attained by $f$ (this sequence might be either finite or infinite). We will prove that for every positive $n$ the function $f$ attains at least $n$ values, and we have $(\\mathrm{i})_{n}: f(x)=y_{n}$ if and only if $x=n$, and (ii) $)_{n}: y_{n}=n$. The proof will follow the scheme\n\n$$\n\\left.(\\mathrm{i})_{1}, \\text { (ii }\\right)_{1},(\\mathrm{i})_{2},(\\text { ii })_{2}, \\ldots,(\\mathrm{i})_{n},(\\text { ii })_{n}, \\ldots\n$$\n\nTo start, consider any $x$ such that $f(x)=y_{1}$. If $x>1$, then (1) reads $f\\left(f^{g(x-1)}(x-1)\\right)<y_{1}$, contradicting the minimality of $y_{1}$. So we have that $f(x)=y_{1}$ is equivalent to $x=1$, establish$\\operatorname{ing}(\\mathrm{i})_{1}$.\n\nNext, assume that for some $n$ statement $(\\mathrm{i})_{n}$ is established, as well as all the previous statements in (2). Note that these statements imply that for all $k \\geq 1$ and $a<n$ we have $f^{k}(x)=a$ if and only if $x=a$.\n\nNow, each value $y_{i}$ with $1 \\leq i \\leq n$ is attained at the unique integer $i$, so $y_{n+1}$ exists. Choose an arbitrary $x$ such that $f(x)=y_{n+1}$; we necessarily have $x>n$. Substituting $x-1$ into (1) we have $f\\left(f^{g(x-1)}(x-1)\\right)<y_{n+1}$, which implies\n\n$$\nf^{g(x-1)}(x-1) \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n\\}\n$$\n\nSet $b=f^{g(x-1)}(x-1)$. If $b<n$ then we would have $x-1=b$ which contradicts $x>n$. So $b=n$, and hence $y_{n}=n$, which proves (ii) ${ }_{n}$. Next, from $(\\mathrm{i})_{n}$ we now get $f(k)=n \\Longleftrightarrow k=n$, so removing all the iterations of $f$ in (3) we obtain $x-1=b=n$, which proves $(\\mathrm{i})_{n+1}$.\n\nSo, all the statements in (2) are valid and hence $f(n)=n$ for all $n$. The given relation between $f$ and $g$ now reads $n+g^{n}(n)=n+1-g(n+1)+1$ or $g^{n}(n)+g(n+1)=2$, from which it immediately follows that we have $g(n)=1$ for all $n$."
