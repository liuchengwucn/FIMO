    "informal_statement": "A positive integer $N$ is called balanced, if $N=1$ or if $N$ can be written as a product of an even number of not necessarily distinct primes. Given positive integers $a$ and $b$, consider the polynomial $P$ defined by $P(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$.\n\nProve that if $P(n)$ is balanced for all positive integers $n$, then $a=b$.",
    "informal_proof": "Define a function $f$ on the set of positive integers by $f(n)=0$ if $n$ is balanced and $f(n)=1$ otherwise. Clearly, $f(n m) \\equiv f(n)+f(m) \\bmod 2$ for all positive integers $n, m$.\n\nNow suppose $P(n)$ is balanced for all positive integers $n$ and $a<b$. Set $n=k(b-a)-a$ for sufficiently large $k$, such that $n$ is positive. Then $P(n)=k(k+1)(b-a)^{2}$, and this number can only be balanced, if $f(k)=f(k+1)$ holds. Thus, the sequence $f(k)$ must become constant for sufficiently large $k$. But this is not possible, as for every prime $p$ we have $f(p)=1$ and for every square $t^{2}$ we have $f\\left(t^{2}\\right)=0$.\n\nHence $a=b$."
