    "informal_statement": "Find all triples $(p, x, y)$ consisting of a prime number $p$ and two positive integers $x$ and $y$ such that $x^{p-1}+y$ and $x+y^{p-1}$ are both powers of $p$.\n\nThe final answer is $(p, x, y) \\in\\{(3,2,5),(3,5,2)\\} \\cup\\left\\{\\left(2, n, 2^{k}-n\\right) \\mid 0<n<2^{k}\\right\\}$.",
    "informal_proof": "For $p=2$, clearly all pairs of two positive integers $x$ and $y$ whose sum is a power of 2 satisfy the condition. Thus we assume in the following that $p>2$, and we let $a$ and $b$ be positive integers such that $x^{p-1}+y=p^{a}$ and $x+y^{p-1}=p^{b}$. Assume further, without loss of generality, that $x \\leqslant y$, so that $p^{a}=x^{p-1}+y \\leqslant x+y^{p-1}=p^{b}$, which means that $a \\leqslant b$ (and thus $\\left.p^{a} \\mid p^{b}\\right)$\n\nNow we have\n\n$$\np^{b}=y^{p-1}+x=\\left(p^{a}-x^{p-1}\\right)^{p-1}+x .\n$$\n\nWe take this equation modulo $p^{a}$ and take into account that $p-1$ is even, which gives us\n\n$$\n0 \\equiv x^{(p-1)^{2}}+x \\quad\\left(\\bmod p^{a}\\right) .\n$$\n\nIf $p \\mid x$, then $p^{a} \\mid x$, since $x^{(p-1)^{2}-1}+1$ is not divisible by $p$ in this case. However, this is impossible, since $x \\leqslant x^{p-1}<p^{a}$. Thus we know that $p \\nmid x$, which means that\n\n$$\np^{a} \\mid x^{(p-1)^{2}-1}+1=x^{p(p-2)}+1 .\n$$\n\nBy FERMAT's little theorem, $x^{(p-1)^{2}} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$, thus $p$ divides $x+1$. Let $p^{r}$ be the highest power of $p$ that divides $x+1$. By the binomial theorem, we have\n\n$$\nx^{p(p-2)}=\\sum_{k=0}^{p(p-2)}\\left(\\begin{array}{c}\np(p-2) \\\\\nk\n\\end{array}\\right)(-1)^{p(p-2)-k}(x+1)^{k} .\n$$\n\nExcept for the terms corresponding to $k=0, k=1$ and $k=2$, all terms in the sum are clearly divisible by $p^{3 r}$ and thus by $p^{r+2}$. The remaining terms are\n\n$$\n-\\frac{p(p-2)\\left(p^{2}-2 p-1\\right)}{2}(x+1)^{2},\n$$\n\nwhich is divisible by $p^{2 r+1}$ and thus also by $p^{r+2}$,\n\n$$\np(p-2)(x+1),\n$$\n\nwhich is divisible by $p^{r+1}$, but not $p^{r+2}$ by our choice of $r$, and the final term $-1$ corresponding to $k=0$. It follows that the highest power of $p$ that divides $x^{p(p-2)}+1$ is $p^{r+1}$.\n\nOn the other hand, we already know that $p^{a}$ divides $x^{p(p-2)}+1$, which means that $a \\leqslant r+1$. Moreover,\n\n$$\np^{r} \\leqslant x+1 \\leqslant x^{p-1}+y=p^{a} .\n$$\n\nHence we either have $a=r$ or $a=r+1$.\n\nIf $a=r$, then $x=y=1$ needs to hold in the inequality above, which is impossible for $p>2$. Thus $a=r+1$. Now since $p^{r} \\leqslant x+1$, we get\n\n$$\nx=\\frac{x^{2}+x}{x+1} \\leqslant \\frac{x^{p-1}+y}{x+1}=\\frac{p^{a}}{x+1} \\leqslant \\frac{p^{a}}{p^{r}}=p,\n$$\n\nso we must have $x=p-1$ for $p$ to divide $x+1$.\n\nIt follows that $r=1$ and $a=2$. If $p \\geqslant 5$, we obtain\n\n$$\np^{a}=x^{p-1}+y>(p-1)^{4}=\\left(p^{2}-2 p+1\\right)^{2}>(3 p)^{2}>p^{2}=p^{a},\n$$\n\na contradiction. So the only case that remains is $p=3$, and indeed $x=2$ and $y=p^{a}-x^{p-1}=5$ satisfy the conditions."
