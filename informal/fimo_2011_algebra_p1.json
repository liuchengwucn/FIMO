    "informal_statement": "For any set $A=\\left\\{a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}\\right\\}$ of four distinct positive integers with sum $s_{A}=a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}$, let $p_{A}$ denote the number of pairs $(i, j)$ with $1 \\leq i<j \\leq 4$ for which $a_{i}+a_{j}$ divides $s_{A}$. Among all sets of four distinct positive integers, determine those sets $A$ for which $p_{A}$ is maximal.\n\nThe final answers are the sets $A$ for which $p_{A}$ is maximal are the sets the form $\\{d, 5 d, 7 d, 11 d\\}$ and $\\{d, 11 d, 19 d, 29 d\\}$, where $d$ is any positive integer. For all these sets $p_{A}$ is 4 .",
    "informal_proof": "Firstly, we will prove that the maximum value of $p_{A}$ is at most 4 . Without loss of generality, we may assume that $a_{1}<a_{2}<a_{3}<a_{4}$. We observe that for each pair of indices $(i, j)$ with $1 \\leq i<j \\leq 4$, the sum $a_{i}+a_{j}$ divides $s_{A}$ if and only if $a_{i}+a_{j}$ divides $s_{A}-\\left(a_{i}+a_{j}\\right)=a_{k}+a_{l}$, where $k$ and $l$ are the other two indices. Since there are 6 distinct pairs, we have to prove that at least two of them do not satisfy the previous condition. We claim that two such pairs are $\\left(a_{2}, a_{4}\\right)$ and $\\left(a_{3}, a_{4}\\right)$. Indeed, note that $a_{2}+a_{4}>a_{1}+a_{3}$ and $a_{3}+a_{4}>a_{1}+a_{2}$. Hence $a_{2}+a_{4}$ and $a_{3}+a_{4}$ do not divide $s_{A}$. This proves $p_{A} \\leq 4$.\n\nNow suppose $p_{A}=4$. By the previous argument we have\n\n$$\n\\begin{array}{llll|l}\na_{1}+a_{4} \\mid a_{2}+a_{3} & \\text { and } & a_{2}+a_{3} \\mid a_{1}+a_{4}, \\\\\na_{1}+a_{2} \\mid a_{3}+a_{4} & \\text { and } & a_{3}+a_{4} \\nless a_{1}+a_{2}, \\\\\na_{1}+a_{3} & a_{2}+a_{4} & \\text { and } & a_{2}+a_{4} \\nless a_{1}+a_{3} .\n\\end{array}\n$$\n\nHence, there exist positive integers $m$ and $n$ with $m>n \\geq 2$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left\\{\\begin{array}{l}\na_{1}+a_{4}=a_{2}+a_{3} \\\\\nm\\left(a_{1}+a_{2}\\right)=a_{3}+a_{4} \\\\\nn\\left(a_{1}+a_{3}\\right)=a_{2}+a_{4}\n\\end{array}\\right.\n$$\n\nAdding up the first equation and the third one, we get $n\\left(a_{1}+a_{3}\\right)=2 a_{2}+a_{3}-a_{1}$. If $n \\geq 3$, then $n\\left(a_{1}+a_{3}\\right)>3 a_{3}>2 a_{2}+a_{3}>2 a_{2}+a_{3}-a_{1}$. This is a contradiction. Therefore $n=2$. If we multiply by 2 the sum of the first equation and the third one, we obtain\n\n$$\n6 a_{1}+2 a_{3}=4 a_{2},\n$$\n\nwhile the sum of the first one and the second one is\n\n$$\n(m+1) a_{1}+(m-1) a_{2}=2 a_{3} .\n$$\n\nAdding up the last two equations we get\n\n$$\n(m+7) a_{1}=(5-m) a_{2} .\n$$\n\nIt follows that $5-m \\geq 1$, because the left-hand side of the last equation and $a_{2}$ are positive. Since we have $m>n=2$, the integer $m$ can be equal only to either 3 or 4 . Substituting $(3,2)$ and $(4,2)$ for $(m, n)$ and solving the previous system of equations, we find the families of solutions $\\{d, 5 d, 7 d, 11 d\\}$ and $\\{d, 11 d, 19 d, 29 d\\}$, where $d$ is any positive integer."
