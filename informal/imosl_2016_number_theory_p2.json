When we express a positive integer $m$ using its prime factorization, we also include the special case $m=1$ by allowing the exponents to be zeros. We first compute $\\tau_{1}(m)$ for a positive integer $m$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item Claim. Let $m=3^{x} p_{1}^{a_{1}} p_{2}^{a_{2}} \\cdots p_{s}^{a_{s}} q_{1}^{b_{1}} q_{2}^{b_{2}} \\cdots q_{t}^{b_{t}}$ be the prime factorization of $m$. Then\n\\end{itemize}\n\n$$\n\\tau_{1}(m)=\\prod_{i=1}^{s}\\left(a_{i}+1\\right)\\left[\\frac{1}{2} \\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nProof. To choose a divisor of $m$ congruent to $1 \\bmod 3$, it cannot have the prime divisor 3, while there is no restriction on choosing prime factors congruent to $1 \\bmod 3$. Also, we have to choose an even number of prime factors (counted with multiplicity) congruent to $2 \\bmod 3$.\n\nIf $\\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)$ is even, then we may assume without loss of generality $b_{1}+1$ is even. We can choose the prime factors $q_{2}, q_{3}, \\ldots, q_{t}$ freely in $\\prod_{j=2}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)$ ways. Then the parity of the number of $q_{1}$ is uniquely determined, and hence there are $\\frac{1}{2}\\left(b_{1}+1\\right)$ ways to choose the exponent of $q_{1}$. Hence (1) is verified in this case.\n\nIf $\\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)$ is odd, we use induction on $t$ to count the number of choices. When $t=1$, there are $\\left\\lceil\\frac{b_{1}+1}{2}\\right\\rceil$ choices for which the exponent is even and $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{b_{1}+1}{2}\\right\\rfloor$ choices for which the exponent is odd. For the inductive step, we find that there are\n\n$$\n\\left\\lceil\\frac{1}{2} \\prod_{j=1}^{t-1}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)\\right\\rceil \\cdot\\left\\lceil\\frac{b_{t}+1}{2}\\right\\rceil+\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1}{2} \\prod_{j=1}^{t-1}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)\\right\\rfloor \\cdot\\left\\lfloor\\frac{b_{t}+1}{2}\\right\\rfloor=\\left\\lceil\\frac{1}{2} \\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)\\right\\rceil\n$$\n\nchoices with an even number of prime factors and hence $\\left\\lfloor\\frac{1}{2} \\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)\\right\\rfloor$ choices with an odd number of prime factors. Hence (1) is also true in this case.\n\nLet $n=3^{x} 2^{y} 5^{z} p_{1}^{a_{1}} p_{2}^{a_{2}} \\cdots p_{s}^{a_{s}} q_{1}^{b_{1}} q_{2}^{b_{2}} \\cdots q_{t}^{b_{t}}$. Using the well-known formula for computing the divisor function, we get\n\n$$\n\\tau(10 n)=(x+1)(y+2)(z+2) \\prod_{i=1}^{s}\\left(a_{i}+1\\right) \\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)\n$$\n\nBy the Claim, we have\n\n$$\n\\tau_{1}(10 n)=\\prod_{i=1}^{s}\\left(a_{i}+1\\right)\\left[\\frac{1}{2}(y+2)(z+2) \\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)\\right]\n$$\n\nIf $c=(y+2)(z+2) \\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right)$ is even, then (2) and (3) imply\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau(10 n)}{\\tau_{1}(10 n)}=2(x+1)\n$$\n\nIn this case $\\frac{\\tau(10 n)}{\\tau_{1}(10 n)}$ can be any even positive integer as $x$ runs through all nonnegative integers. If $c$ is odd, which means $y, z$ are odd and each $b_{j}$ is even, then (2) and (3) imply\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau(10 n)}{\\tau_{1}(10 n)}=\\frac{2(x+1) c}{c+1}\n$$\n\nFor this to be an integer, we need $c+1$ divides $2(x+1)$ since $c$ and $c+1$ are relatively prime. Let $2(x+1)=k(c+1)$. Then $(4)$ reduces to\n\n$$\n\\frac{\\tau(10 n)}{\\tau_{1}(10 n)}=k c=k(y+2)(z+2) \\prod_{j=1}^{t}\\left(b_{j}+1\\right) .\n$$\n\nNoting that $y, z$ are odd, the integers $y+2$ and $z+2$ are at least 3 . This shows the integer in this case must be composite. On the other hand, for any odd composite number $a b$ with $a, b \\geqslant 3$, we may simply take $n=3^{\\frac{a b-1}{2}} \\cdot 2^{a-2} \\cdot 5^{b-2}$ so that $\\frac{\\tau(10 n)}{\\tau_{1}(10 n)}=a b$ from (5).\n\nWe conclude that the fraction can be any even integer or any odd composite number. Equivalently, it can be 2 or any composite number."}
