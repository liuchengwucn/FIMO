{"problem_name": "imosl_2012_algebra_p4", "informal_statement": "Let $f$ and $g$ be two nonzero polynomials with integer coefficients and $\\operatorname{deg} f>\\operatorname{deg} g$. Suppose that for infinitely many primes $p$ the polynomial $p f+g$ has a rational root. Prove that $f$ has a rational root.", "informal_proof": "Since $\\operatorname{deg} f>\\operatorname{deg} g$, we have $|g(x) / f(x)|<1$ for sufficiently large $x$; more precisely, there is a real number $R$ such that $|g(x) / f(x)|<1$ for all $x$ with $|x|>R$. Then for all such $x$ and all primes $p$ we have\n\n$$\n|p f(x)+g(x)| \\geq|f(x)|\\left(p-\\frac{|g(x)|}{|f(x)|}\\right)>0\n$$\n\nHence all real roots of the polynomials $p f+g$ lie in the interval $[-R, R]$.\n\nLet $f(x)=a_{n} x^{n}+a_{n-1} x^{n-1}+\\cdots+a_{0}$ and $g(x)=b_{m} x^{m}+b_{m-1} x^{m-1}+\\cdots+b_{0}$ where $n>m, a_{n} \\neq 0$ and $b_{m} \\neq 0$. Upon replacing $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ by $a_{n}^{n-1} f\\left(x / a_{n}\\right)$ and $a_{n}^{n-1} g\\left(x / a_{n}\\right)$ respectively, we reduce the problem to the case $a_{n}=1$. In other words one can assume that $f$ is monic. Then the leading coefficient of $p f+g$ is $p$, and if $r=u / v$ is a rational root of $p f+g$ with $(u, v)=1$ and $v>0$, then either $v=1$ or $v=p$.\n\nFirst consider the case when $v=1$ infinitely many times. If $v=1$ then $|u| \\leq R$, so there are only finitely many possibilities for the integer $u$. Therefore there exist distinct primes $p$ and $q$ for which we have the same value of $u$. Then the polynomials $p f+g$ and $q f+g$ share this root, implying $f(u)=g(u)=0$. So in this case $f$ and $g$ have an integer root in common.\n\nNow suppose that $v=p$ infinitely many times. By comparing the exponent of $p$ in the denominators of $p f(u / p)$ and $g(u / p)$ we get $m=n-1$ and $p f(u / p)+g(u / p)=0$ reduces to an equation of the form\n\n$$\n\\left(u^{n}+a_{n-1} p u^{n-1}+\\ldots+a_{0} p^{n}\\right)+\\left(b_{n-1} u^{n-1}+b_{n-2} p u^{n-2}+\\ldots+b_{0} p^{n-1}\\right)=0 .\n$$\n\nThe equation above implies that $u^{n}+b_{n-1} u^{n-1}$ is divisible by $p$ and hence, since $(u, p)=1$, we have $u+b_{n-1}=p k$ with some integer $k$. On the other hand all roots of $p f+g$ lie in the interval $[-R, R]$, so that\n\n$$\n\\begin{gathered}\n\\frac{\\left|p k-b_{n-1}\\right|}{p}=\\frac{|u|}{p}<R \\\\\n|k|<R+\\frac{\\left|b_{n-1}\\right|}{p}<R+\\left|b_{n-1}\\right| .\n\\end{gathered}\n$$\n\nTherefore the integer $k$ can attain only finitely many values. Hence there exists an integer $k$ such that the number $\\frac{p k-b_{n-1}}{p}=k-\\frac{b_{n-1}}{p}$ is a root of $p f+g$ for infinitely many primes $p$. For these primes we have\n\n$$\nf\\left(k-b_{n-1} \\frac{1}{p}\\right)+\\frac{1}{p} g\\left(k-b_{n-1} \\frac{1}{p}\\right)=0 .\n$$\n\nSo the equation\n\n$$\nf\\left(k-b_{n-1} x\\right)+x g\\left(k-b_{n-1} x\\right)=0\n$$\n\nhas infinitely many solutions of the form $x=1 / p$. Since the left-hand side is a polynomial, this implies that (1) is a polynomial identity, so it holds for all real $x$. In particular, by substituting $x=0$ in (1) we get $f(k)=0$. Thus the integer $k$ is a root of $f$.\n\nIn summary the monic polynomial $f$ obtained after the initial reduction always has an integer root. Therefore the original polynomial $f$ has a rational root."}
