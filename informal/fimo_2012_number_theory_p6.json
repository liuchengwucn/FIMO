    "informal_statement": "Let $x$ and $y$ be positive integers. If $x^{2^{n}}-1$ is divisible by $2^{n} y+1$ for every positive integer $n$, prove that $x=1$.",
    "informal_proof": "First we prove the following fact: For every positive integer $y$ there exist infinitely many primes $p \\equiv 3(\\bmod 4)$ such that $p$ divides some number of the form $2^{n} y+1$.\n\nClearly it is enough to consider the case $y$ odd. Let\n\n$$\n2 y+1=p_{1}^{e_{1}} \\cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}}\n$$\n\nbe the prime factorization of $2 y+1$. Suppose on the contrary that there are finitely many primes $p_{r+1}, \\ldots, p_{r+s} \\equiv 3(\\bmod 4)$ that divide some number of the form $2^{n} y+1$ but do not divide $2 y+1$.\n\nWe want to find an $n$ such that $p_{i}^{e_{i}} \\| 2^{n} y+1$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq r$ and $p_{i} \\nmid 2^{n} y+1$ for $r+1 \\leq i \\leq r+s$. For this it suffices to take\n\n$$\nn=1+\\varphi\\left(p_{1}^{e_{1}+1} \\cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}+1} p_{r+1}^{1} \\cdots p_{r+s}^{1}\\right),\n$$\n\nbecause then\n\n$$\n2^{n} y+1 \\equiv 2 y+1 \\quad\\left(\\bmod p_{1}^{e_{1}+1} \\cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}+1} p_{r+1}^{1} \\cdots p_{r+s}^{1}\\right)\n$$\n\nThe last congruence means that $p_{1}^{e_{1}}, \\ldots, p_{r}^{e_{r}}$ divide exactly $2^{n} y+1$ and no prime $p_{r+1}, \\ldots, p_{r+s}$ divides $2^{n} y+1$. It follows that the prime factorization of $2^{n} y+1$ consists of the prime powers $p_{1}^{e_{1}}, \\ldots, p_{r}^{e_{r}}$ and powers of primes $\\equiv 1(\\bmod 4)$. Because $y$ is odd, we obtain\n\n$$\n2^{n} y+1 \\equiv p_{1}^{e_{1}} \\cdots p_{r}^{e_{r}} \\equiv 2 y+1 \\equiv 3 \\quad(\\bmod 4)\n$$\n\nThis is a contradiction since $n>1$, and so $2^{n} y+1 \\equiv 1(\\bmod 4)$.\n\nNow we proceed to the problem. If $p$ is a prime divisor of $2^{n} y+1$ the problem statement implies that $x^{d} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$ for $d=2^{n}$. By FERMAT's little theorem the same congruence holds for $d=p-1$, so it must also hold for $d=\\left(2^{n}, p-1\\right)$. For $p \\equiv 3(\\bmod 4)$ we have $\\left(2^{n}, p-1\\right)=2$, therefore in this case $x^{2} \\equiv 1(\\bmod p)$.\n\nIn summary, we proved that every prime $p \\equiv 3(\\bmod 4)$ that divides some number of the form $2^{n} y+1$ also divides $x^{2}-1$. This is possible only if $x=1$, otherwise by the above $x^{2}-1$ would be a positive integer with infinitely many prime factors."
