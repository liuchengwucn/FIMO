    "informal_statement": "Say that an ordered pair $(x, y)$ of integers is an irreducible lattice point if $x$ and $y$ are relatively prime. For any finite set $S$ of irreducible lattice points, show that there is a homogenous polynomial in two variables, $f(x, y)$, with integer coefficients, of degree at least 1 , such that $f(x, y)=1$ for each $(x, y)$ in the set $S$.\n\nNote: A homogenous polynomial of degree $n$ is any nonzero polynomial of the form\n\n$$\nf(x, y)=a_{0} x^{n}+a_{1} x^{n-1} y+a_{2} x^{n-2} y^{2}+\\cdots+a_{n-1} x y^{n-1}+a_{n} y^{n} .\n$$",
    "informal_proof": "First of all, we note that finding a homogenous polynomial $f(x, y)$ such that $f(x, y)=\\pm 1$ is enough, because we then have $f^{2}(x, y)=1$. Label the irreducible lattice points $\\left(x_{1}, y_{1}\\right)$ through $\\left(x_{n}, y_{n}\\right)$. If any two of these lattice points $\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ and $\\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\\right)$ lie on the same line through the origin, then $\\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\\right)=\\left(-x_{i},-y_{i}\\right)$ because both of the points are irreducible. We then have $f\\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\\right)=\\pm f\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ whenever $f$ is homogenous, so we can assume that no two of the lattice points are collinear with the origin by ignoring the extra lattice points.\n\nConsider the homogenous polynomials $\\ell_{i}(x, y)=y_{i} x-x_{i} y$ and define\n\n$$\ng_{i}(x, y)=\\prod_{j \\neq i} \\ell_{j}(x, y)\n$$\n\nThen $\\ell_{i}\\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\\right)=0$ if and only if $j=i$, because there is only one lattice point on each line through the origin. Thus, $g_{i}\\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\\right)=0$ for all $j \\neq i$. Define $a_{i}=g_{i}\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$, and note that $a_{i} \\neq 0$\n\nNote that $g_{i}(x, y)$ is a degree $n-1$ polynomial with the following two properties:\n\n\\begin{enumerate}\n  \\item $g_{i}\\left(x_{j}, y_{j}\\right)=0$ if $j \\neq i$.\n\n  \\item $g_{i}\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)=a_{i}$.\n\n\\end{enumerate}\n\nFor any $N \\geqslant n-1$, there also exists a polynomial of degree $N$ with the same two properties. Specifically, let $I_{i}(x, y)$ be a degree 1 homogenous polynomial such that $I_{i}\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)=1$, which exists since $\\left(x_{i}, y_{i}\\right)$ is irreducible. Then $I_{i}(x, y)^{N-(n-1)} g_{i}(x, y)$ satisfies both of the above properties and has degree $N$.\n\nWe may now reduce the problem to the following claim:\n\nClaim: For each positive integer a, there is a homogenous polynomial $f_{a}(x, y)$, with integer coefficients, of degree at least 1, such that $f_{a}(x, y) \\equiv 1(\\bmod a)$ for all relatively prime $(x, y)$.\n\nTo see that this claim solves the problem, take $a$ to be the least common multiple of the numbers $a_{i}(1 \\leqslant i \\leqslant n)$. Take $f_{a}$ given by the claim, choose some power $f_{a}(x, y)^{k}$ that has degree at least $n-1$, and subtract appropriate multiples of the $g_{i}$ constructed above to obtain the desired polynomial.\n\nWe prove the claim by factoring $a$. First, if $a$ is a power of a prime $\\left(a=p^{k}\\right)$, then we may choose either:\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item $f_{a}(x, y)=\\left(x^{p-1}+y^{p-1}\\right)^{\\phi(a)}$ if $p$ is odd;\n\n  \\item $f_{a}(x, y)=\\left(x^{2}+x y+y^{2}\\right)^{\\phi(a)}$ if $p=2$.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n\nNow suppose $a$ is any positive integer, and let $a=q_{1} q_{2} \\cdots q_{k}$, where the $q_{i}$ are prime powers, pairwise relatively prime. Let $f_{q_{i}}$ be the polynomials just constructed, and let $F_{q_{i}}$ be powers of these that all have the same degree. Note that\n\n$$\n\\frac{a}{q_{i}} F_{q_{i}}(x, y) \\equiv \\frac{a}{q_{i}} \\quad(\\bmod a)\n$$\n\nfor any relatively prime $x, y$. By B\u00e9zout's lemma, there is an integer linear combination of the $\\frac{a}{q_{i}}$ that equals 1 . Thus, there is a linear combination of the $F_{q_{i}}$ such that $F_{q_{i}}(x, y) \\equiv 1$ $(\\bmod a)$ for any relatively prime $(x, y)$; and this polynomial is homogenous because all the $F_{q_{i}}$ have the same degree."
