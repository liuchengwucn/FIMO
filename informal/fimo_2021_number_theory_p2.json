    "informal_statement": "Let $n \\geqslant 100$ be an integer. The numbers $n, n+1, \\ldots, 2 n$ are written on $n+1$ cards, one number per card. The cards are shuffled and divided into two piles. Prove that one of the piles contains two cards such that the sum of their numbers is a perfect square.",
    "informal_proof": "To solve the problem it suffices to find three squares and three cards with numbers $a, b, c$ on them such that pairwise sums $a+b, b+c, a+c$ are equal to the chosen squares. By choosing the three consecutive squares $(2 k-1)^{2},(2 k)^{2},(2 k+1)^{2}$ we arrive at the triple\n\n$$\n(a, b, c)=\\left(2 k^{2}-4 k, \\quad 2 k^{2}+1, \\quad 2 k^{2}+4 k\\right)\n$$\n\nWe need a value for $k$ such that\n\n$$\nn \\leqslant 2 k^{2}-4 k, \\quad \\text { and } 2 k^{2}+4 k \\leqslant 2 n .\n$$\n\nA concrete $k$ is suitable for all $n$ with\n\n$$\nn \\in\\left[k^{2}+2 k, 2 k^{2}-4 k+1\\right]=: I_{k}\n$$\n\nFor $k \\geqslant 9$ the intervals $I_{k}$ and $I_{k+1}$ overlap because\n\n$$\n(k+1)^{2}+2(k+1) \\leqslant 2 k^{2}-4 k+1\n$$\n\nHence $I_{9} \\cup I_{10} \\cup \\ldots=[99, \\infty)$, which proves the statement for $n \\geqslant 99$."
