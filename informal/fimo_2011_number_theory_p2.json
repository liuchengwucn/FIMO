    "informal_statement": "Consider a polynomial $P(x)=\\left(x+d_{1}\\right)\\left(x+d_{2}\\right) \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot\\left(x+d_{9}\\right)$, where $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{9}$ are nine distinct integers. Prove that there exists an integer $N$ such that for all integers $x \\geq N$ the number $P(x)$ is divisible by a prime number greater than 20 .",
    "informal_proof": "Note that the statement of the problem is invariant under translations of $x$; hence without loss of generality we may suppose that the numbers $d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{9}$ are positive.\n\nThe key observation is that there are only eight primes below 20 , while $P(x)$ involves more than eight factors.\n\nWe shall prove that $N=d^{8}$ satisfies the desired property, where $d=\\max \\left\\{d_{1}, d_{2}, \\ldots, d_{9}\\right\\}$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is some integer $x \\geq N$ such that $P(x)$ is composed of primes below 20 only. Then for every index $i \\in\\{1,2, \\ldots, 9\\}$ the number $x+d_{i}$ can be expressed as product of powers of the first 8 primes.\n\nSince $x+d_{i}>x \\geq d^{8}$ there is some prime power $f_{i}>d$ that divides $x+d_{i}$. Invoking the pigeonhole principle we see that there are two distinct indices $i$ and $j$ such that $f_{i}$ and $f_{j}$ are powers of the same prime number. For reasons of symmetry, we may suppose that $f_{i} \\leq f_{j}$. Now both of the numbers $x+d_{i}$ and $x+d_{j}$ are divisible by $f_{i}$ and hence so is their difference $d_{i}-d_{j}$. But as\n\n$$\n0<\\left|d_{i}-d_{j}\\right| \\leq \\max \\left(d_{i}, d_{j}\\right) \\leq d<f_{i},\n$$\n\nthis is impossible. Thereby the problem is solved."
