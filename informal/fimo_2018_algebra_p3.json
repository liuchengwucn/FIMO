    "informal_statement": "Given any set $S$ of positive integers, show that at least one of the following two assertions holds:\n\n(1) There exist distinct finite subsets $F$ and $G$ of $S$ such that $\\sum_{x \\in F} 1 / x=\\sum_{x \\in G} 1 / x$;\n\n(2) There exists a positive rational number $r<1$ such that $\\sum_{x \\in F} 1 / x \\neq r$ for all finite subsets $F$ of $S$.",
    "informal_proof": "Argue indirectly. Agree, as usual, that the empty sum is 0 to consider rationals in $[0,1)$; adjoining 0 causes no harm, since $\\sum_{x \\in F} 1 / x=0$ for no nonempty finite subset $F$ of $S$. For every rational $r$ in $[0,1)$, let $F_{r}$ be the unique finite subset of $S$ such that $\\sum_{x \\in F_{r}} 1 / x=r$. The argument hinges on the lemma below.\n\nLemma. If $x$ is a member of $S$ and $q$ and $r$ are rationals in [0,1) such that $q-r=1 / x$, then $x$ is a member of $F_{q}$ if and only if it is not one of $F_{r}$.\n\nProof. If $x$ is a member of $F_{q}$, then\n\n$$\n\\sum_{y \\in F_{q} \\backslash\\{x\\}} \\frac{1}{y}=\\sum_{y \\in F_{q}} \\frac{1}{y}-\\frac{1}{x}=q-\\frac{1}{x}=r=\\sum_{y \\in F_{r}} \\frac{1}{y},\n$$\n\nso $F_{r}=F_{q} \\backslash\\{x\\}$, and $x$ is not a member of $F_{r}$. Conversely, if $x$ is not a member of $F_{r}$, then\n\n$$\n\\sum_{y \\in F_{r} \\cup\\{x\\}} \\frac{1}{y}=\\sum_{y \\in F_{r}} \\frac{1}{y}+\\frac{1}{x}=r+\\frac{1}{x}=q=\\sum_{y \\in F_{q}} \\frac{1}{y},\n$$\n\nso $F_{q}=F_{r} \\cup\\{x\\}$, and $x$ is a member of $F_{q}$.\n\nConsider now an element $x$ of $S$ and a positive rational $r<1$. Let $n=\\lfloor r x\\rfloor$ and consider the sets $F_{r-k / x}, k=0, \\ldots, n$. Since $0 \\leqslant r-n / x<1 / x$, the set $F_{r-n / x}$ does not contain $x$, and a repeated application of the lemma shows that the $F_{r-(n-2 k) / x}$ do not contain $x$, whereas the $F_{r-(n-2 k-1) / x}$ do. Consequently, $x$ is a member of $F_{r}$ if and only if $n$ is odd.\n\nFinally, consider $F_{2 / 3}$. By the preceding, $\\lfloor 2 x / 3\\rfloor$ is odd for each $x$ in $F_{2 / 3}$, so $2 x / 3$ is not integral. Since $F_{2 / 3}$ is finite, there exists a positive rational $\\varepsilon$ such that $\\lfloor(2 / 3-\\varepsilon) x\\rfloor=\\lfloor 2 x / 3\\rfloor$ for all $x$ in $F_{2 / 3}$. This implies that $F_{2 / 3}$ is a subset of $F_{2 / 3-\\varepsilon}$ which is impossible."
