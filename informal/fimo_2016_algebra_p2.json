    "informal_statement": "Find the smallest real constant $C$ such that for any positive real numbers $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, a_{4}$ and $a_{5}$ (not necessarily distinct), one can always choose distinct subscripts $i, j, k$ and $l$ such that\n\n$$\n\\left|\\frac{a_{i}}{a_{j}}-\\frac{a_{k}}{a_{l}}\\right| \\leqslant C .\n$$\n\nThe final answer is that the smallest $C$ is $\\frac{1}{2}$.",
    "informal_proof": "We first show that $C \\leqslant \\frac{1}{2}$. For any positive real numbers $a_{1} \\leqslant a_{2} \\leqslant a_{3} \\leqslant a_{4} \\leqslant a_{5}$, consider the five fractions\n\n$$\n\\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}, \\frac{a_{3}}{a_{4}}, \\frac{a_{1}}{a_{5}}, \\frac{a_{2}}{a_{3}}, \\frac{a_{4}}{a_{5}} .\n$$\n\nEach of them lies in the interval $(0,1]$. Therefore, by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least three of them must lie in $\\left(0, \\frac{1}{2}\\right]$ or lie in $\\left(\\frac{1}{2}, 1\\right]$ simultaneously. In particular, there must be two consecutive terms in (2) which belong to an interval of length $\\frac{1}{2}$ (here, we regard $\\frac{a_{1}}{a_{2}}$ and $\\frac{a_{4}}{a_{5}}$ as consecutive). In other words, the difference of these two fractions is less than $\\frac{1}{2}$. As the indices involved in these two fractions are distinct, we can choose them to be $i, j, k, l$ and conclude that $C \\leqslant \\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nNext, we show that $C=\\frac{1}{2}$ is best possible. Consider the numbers $1,2,2,2, n$ where $n$ is a large real number. The fractions formed by two of these numbers in ascending order are $\\frac{1}{n}, \\frac{2}{n}, \\frac{1}{2}, \\frac{2}{2}, \\frac{2}{1}, \\frac{n}{2}, \\frac{n}{1}$. Since the indices $i, j, k, l$ are distinct, $\\frac{1}{n}$ and $\\frac{2}{n}$ cannot be chosen simultaneously. Therefore the minimum value of the left-hand side of $(1)$ is $\\frac{1}{2}-\\frac{2}{n}$. When $n$ tends to infinity, this value approaches $\\frac{1}{2}$, and so $C$ cannot be less than $\\frac{1}{2}$.\n\nThese conclude that $C=\\frac{1}{2}$ is the smallest possible choice."
