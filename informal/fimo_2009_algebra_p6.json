Prove that $s_{1}, s_{2}, s_{3}, \\ldots$ is itself an arithmetic progression.",
    "informal_proof": "Let $D$ be the common difference of the progression $s_{s_{1}}, s_{s_{2}}, \\ldots$. Let for $n=$ $1,2, \\ldots$\n\n$$\nd_{n}=s_{n+1}-s_{n} .\n$$\n\nWe have to prove that $d_{n}$ is constant. First we show that the numbers $d_{n}$ are bounded. Indeed, by supposition $d_{n} \\geq 1$ for all $n$. Thus, we have for all $n$\n\n$$\nd_{n}=s_{n+1}-s_{n} \\leq d_{s_{n}}+d_{s_{n}+1}+\\cdots+d_{s_{n+1}-1}=s_{s_{n+1}}-s_{s_{n}}=D .\n$$\n\nThe boundedness implies that there exist\n\n$$\nm=\\min \\left\\{d_{n}: n=1,2, \\ldots\\right\\} \\quad \\text { and } \\quad M=\\max \\left\\{d_{n}: n=1,2, \\ldots\\right\\} .\n$$\n\nIt suffices to show that $m=M$. Assume that $m<M$. Choose $n$ such that $d_{n}=m$. Considering a telescoping sum of $m=d_{n}=s_{n+1}-s_{n}$ items not greater than $M$ leads to\n\n$$\nD=s_{s_{n+1}}-s_{s_{n}}=s_{s_{n}+m}-s_{s_{n}}=d_{s_{n}}+d_{s_{n}+1}+\\cdots+d_{s_{n}+m-1} \\leq m M\n$$\n\nand equality holds if and only if all items of the sum are equal to $M$. Now choose $n$ such that $d_{n}=M$. In the same way, considering a telescoping sum of $M$ items not less than $m$ we obtain\n\n$$\nD=s_{s_{n+1}}-s_{s_{n}}=s_{s_{n}+M}-s_{s_{n}}=d_{s_{n}}+d_{s_{n}+1}+\\cdots+d_{s_{n}+M-1} \\geq M m\n$$\n\nand equality holds if and only if all items of the sum are equal to $m$. The inequalities (1) and (2) imply that $D=M m$ and that\n\n$$\n\\begin{aligned}\nd_{s_{n}}=d_{s_{n}+1}=\\cdots=d_{s_{n+1}-1}=M & \\text { if } d_{n}=m \\\\\nd_{s_{n}}=d_{s_{n}+1}=\\cdots=d_{s_{n+1}-1}=m & \\text { if } d_{n}=M\n\\end{aligned}\n$$\n\nHence, $d_{n}=m$ implies $d_{s_{n}}=M$. Note that $s_{n} \\geq s_{1}+(n-1) \\geq n$ for all $n$ and moreover $s_{n}>n$ if $d_{n}=n$, because in the case $s_{n}=n$ we would have $m=d_{n}=d_{s_{n}}=M$ in contradiction to the assumption $m<M$. In the same way $d_{n}=M$ implies $d_{s_{n}}=m$ and $s_{n}>n$. Consequently, there is a strictly increasing sequence $n_{1}, n_{2}, \\ldots$ such that\n\n$$\nd_{s_{n_{1}}}=M, \\quad d_{s_{n_{2}}}=m, \\quad d_{s_{n_{3}}}=M, \\quad d_{s_{n_{4}}}=m, \\quad \\ldots\n$$\n\nThe sequence $d_{s_{1}}, d_{s_{2}}, \\ldots$ is the sequence of pairwise differences of $s_{s_{1}+1}, s_{s_{2}+1}, \\ldots$ and $s_{s_{1}}, s_{s_{2}}, \\ldots$, hence also an arithmetic progression. Thus $m=M$."
