    "informal_statement": "Let $f: \\mathbb{N} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{N}$ be a function, and let $f^{m}$ be $f$ applied $m$ times. Suppose that for every $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ there exists a $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that $f^{2 k}(n)=n+k$, and let $k_{n}$ be the smallest such $k$. Prove that the sequence $k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots$ is unbounded.",
    "informal_proof": "We restrict attention to the set\n\n$$\nS=\\left\\{1, f(1), f^{2}(1), \\ldots\\right\\} .\n$$\n\nObserve that $S$ is unbounded because for every number $n$ in $S$ there exists a $k>0$ such that $f^{2 k}(n)=n+k$ is in $S$. Clearly $f$ maps $S$ into itself; moreover $f$ is injective on $S$. Indeed if $f^{i}(1)=f^{j}(1)$ with $i \\neq j$ then the values $f^{m}(1)$ start repeating periodically from some point on, and $S$ would be finite.\n\nDefine $g: S \\rightarrow S$ by $g(n)=f^{2 k_{n}}(n)=n+k_{n}$. We prove that $g$ is injective too. Suppose that $g(a)=g(b)$ with $a<b$. Then $a+k_{a}=f^{2 k_{a}}(a)=f^{2 k_{b}}(b)=b+k_{b}$ implies $k_{a}>k_{b}$. So, since $f$ is injective on $S$, we obtain\n\n$$\nf^{2\\left(k_{a}-k_{b}\\right)}(a)=b=a+\\left(k_{a}-k_{b}\\right)\n$$\n\nHowever this contradicts the minimality of $k_{a}$ as $0<k_{a}-k_{b}<k_{a}$.\n\nLet $T$ be the set of elements of $S$ that are not of the form $g(n)$ with $n \\in S$. Note that $1 \\in T$ by $g(n)>n$ for $n \\in S$, so $T$ is non-empty. For each $t \\in T \\operatorname{denote} C_{t}=\\left\\{t, g(t), g^{2}(t), \\ldots\\right\\}$; call $C_{t}$ the chain starting at $t$. Observe that distinct chains are disjoint because $g$ is injective. Each $n \\in S \\backslash T$ has the form $n=g\\left(n^{\\prime}\\right)$ with $n^{\\prime}<n, n^{\\prime} \\in S$. Repeated applications of the same observation show that $n \\in C_{t}$ for some $t \\in T$, i. e. $S$ is the disjoint union of the chains $C_{t}$.\n\nIf $f^{n}(1)$ is in the chain $C_{t}$ starting at $t=f^{n_{t}}(1)$ then $n=n_{t}+2 a_{1}+\\cdots+2 a_{j}$ with\n\n$$\nf^{n}(1)=g^{j}\\left(f^{n_{t}}(1)\\right)=f^{2 a_{j}}\\left(f^{2 a_{j-1}}\\left(\\cdots f^{2 a_{1}}\\left(f^{n_{t}}(1)\\right)\\right)\\right)=f^{n_{t}}(1)+a_{1}+\\cdots+a_{j} .\n$$\n\nHence\n\n$$\nf^{n}(1)=f^{n_{t}}(1)+\\frac{n-n_{t}}{2}=t+\\frac{n-n_{t}}{2} .\n$$\n\nNow we show that $T$ is infinite. We argue by contradiction. Suppose that there are only finitely many chains $C_{t_{1}}, \\ldots, C_{t_{r}}$, starting at $t_{1}<\\cdots<t_{r}$. Fix $N$. If $f^{n}(1)$ with $1 \\leq n \\leq N$ is in $C_{t}$ then $f^{n}(1)=t+\\frac{n-n_{t}}{2} \\leq t_{r}+\\frac{N}{2}$ by (1). But then the $N+1$ distinct natural numbers $1, f(1), \\ldots, f^{N}(1)$ are all less than $t_{r}+\\frac{N}{2}$ and hence $N+1 \\leq t_{r}+\\frac{N}{2}$. This is a contradiction if $N$ is sufficiently large, and hence $T$ is infinite.\n\nTo complete the argument, choose any $k$ in $\\mathbb{N}$ and consider the $k+1$ chains starting at the first $k+1$ numbers in $T$. Let $t$ be the greatest one among these numbers. Then each of the chains in question contains a number not exceeding $t$, and at least one of them does not contain any number among $t+1, \\ldots, t+k$. So there is a number $n$ in this chain such that $g(n)-n>k$, i. e. $k_{n}>k$. In conclusion $k_{1}, k_{2}, \\ldots$ is unbounded."
