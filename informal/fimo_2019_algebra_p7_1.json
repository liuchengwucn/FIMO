    "informal_statement": "Let $\\mathbb{Z}$ be the set of integers. We consider functions $f: \\mathbb{Z} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{Z}$ satisfying\n\n$$\nf(f(x+y)+y)=f(f(x)+y)\n$$\n\nfor all integers $x$ and $y$. For such a function, we say that an integer $v$ is $f$-rare if the set\n\n$$\nX_{v}=\\{x \\in \\mathbb{Z}: f(x)=v\\}\n$$\n\nis finite and nonempty.\n\nProve that there exists such a function $f$ for which there is an $f$-rare integer.",
    "informal_proof": "Let $f$ be the function where $f(0)=0$ and $f(x)$ is the largest power of 2 dividing $2 x$ for $x \\neq 0$. The integer 0 is evidently $f$-rare, so it remains to verify the functional equation.\n\nSince $f(2 x)=2 f(x)$ for all $x$, it suffices to verify the functional equation when at least one of $x$ and $y$ is odd (the case $x=y=0$ being trivial). If $y$ is odd, then we have\n\n$$\nf(f(x+y)+y)=2=f(f(x)+y)\n$$\n\nsince all the values attained by $f$ are even. If, on the other hand, $x$ is odd and $y$ is even, then we already have\n\n$$\nf(x+y)=2=f(x)\n$$\n\nfrom which the functional equation follows immediately."
