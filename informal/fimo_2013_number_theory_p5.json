    "informal_statement": "Fix an integer $k \\geqslant 2$. Two players, called Ana and Banana, play the following game of numbers: Initially, some integer $n \\geqslant k$ gets written on the blackboard. Then they take moves in turn, with Ana beginning. A player making a move erases the number $m$ just written on the blackboard and replaces it by some number $m^{\\prime}$ with $k \\leqslant m^{\\prime}<m$ that is coprime to $m$. The first player who cannot move anymore loses.\n\nAn integer $n \\geqslant k$ is called good if Banana has a winning strategy when the initial number is $n$, and $b a d$ otherwise.\n\nConsider two integers $n, n^{\\prime} \\geqslant k$ with the property that each prime number $p \\leqslant k$ divides $n$ if and only if it divides $n^{\\prime}$. Prove that either both $n$ and $n^{\\prime}$ are good or both are bad.",
    "informal_proof": "Let us first observe that the number appearing on the blackboard decreases after every move; so the game necessarily ends after at most $n$ steps, and consequently there always has to be some player possessing a winning strategy. So if some $n \\geqslant k$ is bad, then Ana has a winning strategy in the game with starting number $n$.\n\nMore precisely, if $n \\geqslant k$ is such that there is a good integer $m$ with $n>m \\geqslant k$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$, then $n$ itself is bad, for Ana has the following winning strategy in the game with initial number $n$ : She proceeds by first playing $m$ and then using Banana's strategy for the game with starting number $m$.\n\nOtherwise, if some integer $n \\geqslant k$ has the property that every integer $m$ with $n>m \\geqslant k$ and $\\operatorname{gcd}(m, n)=1$ is bad, then $n$ is good. Indeed, if Ana can make a first move at all in the game with initial number $n$, then she leaves it in a position where the first player has a winning strategy, so that Banana can defeat her.\n\nIn particular, this implies that any two good numbers have a non-trivial common divisor. Also, $k$ itself is good.\n\nFor brevity, we say that $n \\longrightarrow x$ is a move if $n$ and $x$ are two coprime integers with $n>x \\geqslant k$.\n\nClaim 1. If $n$ is good and $n^{\\prime}$ is a multiple of $n$, then $n^{\\prime}$ is also good.\n\nProof. If $n^{\\prime}$ were bad, there would have to be some move $n^{\\prime} \\longrightarrow x$, where $x$ is good. As $n^{\\prime}$ is a multiple of $n$ this implies that the two good numbers $n$ and $x$ are coprime, which is absurd.\n\nClaim 2. If $r$ and s denote two positive integers for which $r s \\geqslant k$ is bad, then $r^{2} s$ is also bad. Proof. Since $r s$ is bad, there is a move $r s \\longrightarrow x$ for some good $x$. Evidently $x$ is coprime to $r^{2} s$ as well, and hence the move $r^{2} s \\longrightarrow x$ shows that $r^{2} s$ is indeed bad.\n\nClaim 3. If $p>k$ is prime and $n \\geqslant k$ is bad, then $n p$ is also bad.\n\nProof. Otherwise we choose a counterexample with $n$ being as small as possible. In particular, $n p$ is good. Since $n$ is bad, there is a move $n \\longrightarrow x$ for some good $x$. Now $n p \\longrightarrow x$ cannot be a valid move, which tells us that $x$ has to be divisible by $p$. So we can write $x=p^{r} y$, where $r$ and $y$ denote some positive integers, the latter of which is not divisible by $p$.\n\nNote that $y=1$ is impossible, for then we would have $x=p^{r}$ and the move $x \\longrightarrow k$ would establish that $x$ is bad. In view of this, there is a least power $y^{\\alpha}$ of $y$ that is at least as large as $k$. Since the numbers $n p$ and $y^{\\alpha}$ are coprime and the former is good, the latter has to be bad. Moreover, the minimality of $\\alpha$ implies $y^{\\alpha}<k y<p y=\\frac{x}{p^{r-1}}<\\frac{n}{p^{r-1}}$. So $p^{r-1} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}<n$ and consequently all the numbers $y^{\\alpha}, p y^{\\alpha}, \\ldots, p^{r} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}=p\\left(p^{r-1} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}\\right)$ are bad due to the minimal choice of $n$. But now by Claim 1 the divisor $x$ of $p^{r} \\cdot y^{\\alpha}$ cannot be good, whereby we have reached a contradiction that proves Claim 3. We now deduce the statement of the problem from these three claims. To this end, we call two integers $a, b \\geqslant k$ similar if they are divisible by the same prime numbers not exceeding $k$. We are to prove that if $a$ and $b$ are similar, then either both of them are good or both are bad. As in this case the product $a b$ is similar to both $a$ and $b$, it suffices to show the following: if $c \\geqslant k$ is similar to some of its multiples $d$, then either both $c$ and $d$ are good or both are bad.\n\nAssuming that this is not true in general, we choose a counterexample $\\left(c_{0}, d_{0}\\right)$ with $d_{0}$ being as small as possible. By Claim $1, c_{0}$ is bad whilst $d_{0}$ is good. Plainly $d_{0}$ is strictly greater than $c_{0}$ and hence the quotient $\\frac{d_{0}}{c_{0}}$ has some prime factor $p$. Clearly $p$ divides $d_{0}$. If $p \\leqslant k$, then $p$ divides $c_{0}$ as well due to the similarity, and hence $d_{0}$ is actually divisible by $p^{2}$. So $\\frac{d_{0}}{p}$ is good by the contrapositive of Claim 2. Since $c_{0} \\mid \\frac{d_{0}}{p}$, the pair $\\left(c_{0}, \\frac{d_{0}}{p}\\right)$ contradicts the supposed minimality of $d_{0}$. This proves $p>k$, but now we get the same contradiction using Claim 3 instead of Claim 2. Thereby the problem is solved."
