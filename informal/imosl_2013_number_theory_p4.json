{"problem_name": "imosl_2013_number_theory_p4", "informal_statement": "Determine whether there exists an infinite sequence of nonzero digits $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ and a positive integer $N$ such that for every integer $k>N$, the number $\\overline{a_{k} a_{k-1} \\ldots a_{1}}$ is a perfect square.\n\nThe final answer is no.", "informal_proof": "Assume that $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \\ldots$ is such a sequence. For each positive integer $k$, let $y_{k}=$ $\\overline{a_{k} a_{k-1} \\ldots a_{1}}$. By the assumption, for each $k>N$ there exists a positive integer $x_{k}$ such that $y_{k}=x_{k}^{2}$.\n\nI. For every $n$, let $5^{\\gamma_{n}}$ be the greatest power of 5 dividing $x_{n}$. Let us show first that $2 \\gamma_{n} \\geqslant n$ for every positive integer $n>N$.\n\nAssume, to the contrary, that there exists a positive integer $n>N$ such that $2 \\gamma_{n}<n$, which yields\n\n$$\ny_{n+1}=\\overline{a_{n+1} a_{n} \\ldots a_{1}}=10^{n} a_{n+1}+\\overline{a_{n} a_{n-1} \\ldots a_{1}}=10^{n} a_{n+1}+y_{n}=5^{2 \\gamma_{n}}\\left(2^{n} 5^{n-2 \\gamma_{n}} a_{n+1}+\\frac{y_{n}}{5^{2 \\gamma_{n}}}\\right) .\n$$\n\nSince $5 \\backslash y_{n} / 5^{2 \\gamma_{n}}$, we obtain $\\gamma_{n+1}=\\gamma_{n}<n<n+1$. By the same arguments we obtain that $\\gamma_{n}=\\gamma_{n+1}=\\gamma_{n+2}=\\ldots$. Denote this common value by $\\gamma$.\n\nNow, for each $k \\geqslant n$ we have\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{k+1}-x_{k}\\right)\\left(x_{k+1}+x_{k}\\right)=x_{k+1}^{2}-x_{k}^{2}=y_{k+1}-y_{k}=a_{k+1} \\cdot 10^{k} .\n$$\n\nOne of the numbers $x_{k+1}-x_{k}$ and $x_{k+1}+x_{k}$ is not divisible by $5^{\\gamma+1}$ since otherwise one would have $5^{\\gamma+1} \\mid\\left(\\left(x_{k+1}-x_{k}\\right)+\\left(x_{k+1}+x_{k}\\right)\\right)=2 x_{k+1}$. On the other hand, we have $5^{k} \\mid\\left(x_{k+1}-x_{k}\\right)\\left(x_{k+1}+x_{k}\\right)$, so $5^{k-\\gamma}$ divides one of these two factors. Thus we get\n\n$$\n5^{k-\\gamma} \\leqslant \\max \\left\\{x_{k+1}-x_{k}, x_{k+1}+x_{k}\\right\\}<2 x_{k+1}=2 \\sqrt{y_{k+1}}<2 \\cdot 10^{(k+1) / 2},\n$$\n\nwhich implies $5^{2 k}<4 \\cdot 5^{2 \\gamma} \\cdot 10^{k+1}$, or $(5 / 2)^{k}<40 \\cdot 5^{2 \\gamma}$. The last inequality is clearly false for sufficiently large values of $k$. This contradiction shows that $2 \\gamma_{n} \\geqslant n$ for all $n>N$.\n\nII. Consider now any integer $k>\\max \\{N / 2,2\\}$. Since $2 \\gamma_{2 k+1} \\geqslant 2 k+1$ and $2 \\gamma_{2 k+2} \\geqslant 2 k+2$, we have $\\gamma_{2 k+1} \\geqslant k+1$ and $\\gamma_{2 k+2} \\geqslant k+1$. So, from $y_{2 k+2}=a_{2 k+2} \\cdot 10^{2 k+1}+y_{2 k+1}$ we obtain $5^{2 k+2} \\mid y_{2 k+2}-y_{2 k+1}=a_{2 k+2} \\cdot 10^{2 k+1}$ and thus $5 \\mid a_{2 k+2}$, which implies $a_{2 k+2}=5$. Therefore,\n\n$$\n\\left(x_{2 k+2}-x_{2 k+1}\\right)\\left(x_{2 k+2}+x_{2 k+1}\\right)=x_{2 k+2}^{2}-x_{2 k+1}^{2}=y_{2 k+2}-y_{2 k+1}=5 \\cdot 10^{2 k+1}=2^{2 k+1} \\cdot 5^{2 k+2} .\n$$\n\nSetting $A_{k}=x_{2 k+2} / 5^{k+1}$ and $B_{k}=x_{2 k+1} / 5^{k+1}$, which are integers, we obtain\n\n$$\n\\left(A_{k}-B_{k}\\right)\\left(A_{k}+B_{k}\\right)=2^{2 k+1} .\n$$\n\nBoth $A_{k}$ and $B_{k}$ are odd, since otherwise $y_{2 k+2}$ or $y_{2 k+1}$ would be a multiple of 10 which is false by $a_{1} \\neq 0$; so one of the numbers $A_{k}-B_{k}$ and $A_{k}+B_{k}$ is not divisible by 4 . Therefore (1) yields $A_{k}-B_{k}=2$ and $A_{k}+B_{k}=2^{2 k}$, hence $A_{k}=2^{2 k-1}+1$ and thus\n\n$$\nx_{2 k+2}=5^{k+1} A_{k}=10^{k+1} \\cdot 2^{k-2}+5^{k+1}>10^{k+1} \\text {, }\n$$\n\nsince $k \\geqslant 2$. This implies that $y_{2 k+2}>10^{2 k+2}$ which contradicts the fact that $y_{2 k+2}$ contains $2 k+2$ digits. The desired result follows."}
