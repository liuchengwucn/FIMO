    "informal_proof": "Assume that $x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n+1}$ are integers. Define the integers\n\n$$\na_{k}=x_{k}-1=\\frac{m+k}{n+k}-1=\\frac{m-n}{n+k}>0\n$$\n\nfor $k=1,2, \\ldots, n+1$.\n\nLet $P=x_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{n+1}-1$. We need to prove that $P$ is divisible by an odd prime, or in other words, that $P$ is not a power of 2 . To this end, we investigate the powers of 2 dividing the numbers $a_{k}$.\n\nLet $2^{d}$ be the largest power of 2 dividing $m-n$, and let $2^{c}$ be the largest power of 2 not exceeding $2 n+1$. Then $2 n+1 \\leqslant 2^{c+1}-1$, and so $n+1 \\leqslant 2^{c}$. We conclude that $2^{c}$ is one of the numbers $n+1, n+2, \\ldots, 2 n+1$, and that it is the only multiple of $2^{c}$ appearing among these numbers. Let $\\ell$ be such that $n+\\ell=2^{c}$. Since $\\frac{m-n}{n+\\ell}$ is an integer, we have $d \\geqslant c$. Therefore, $2^{d-c+1} \\nmid a_{\\ell}=\\frac{m-n}{n+\\ell}$, while $2^{d-c+1} \\mid a_{k}$ for all $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n+1\\} \\backslash\\{\\ell\\}$.\n\nComputing modulo $2^{d-c+1}$, we get\n\n$$\nP=\\left(a_{1}+1\\right)\\left(a_{2}+1\\right) \\cdots\\left(a_{n+1}+1\\right)-1 \\equiv\\left(a_{\\ell}+1\\right) \\cdot 1^{n}-1 \\equiv a_{\\ell} \\not \\equiv 0 \\quad\\left(\\bmod 2^{d-c+1}\\right) .\n$$\n\nTherefore, $2^{d-c+1} \\nmid P$.\n\nOn the other hand, for any $k \\in\\{1, \\ldots, n+1\\} \\backslash\\{\\ell\\}$, we have $2^{d-c+1} \\mid a_{k}$. So $P \\geqslant a_{k} \\geqslant 2^{d-c+1}$, and it follows that $P$ is not a power of 2 .\n\nComment. Instead of attempting to show that $P$ is not a power of 2 , one may try to find an odd factor of $P$ (greater than 1 ) as follows:\n\nFrom $a_{k}=\\frac{m-n}{n+k} \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{>0}$, we get that $m-n$ is divisible by $n+1, n+2, \\ldots, 2 n+1$, and thus it is also divisible by their least common multiple $L$. So $m-n=q L$ for some positive integer $q$; hence $x_{k}=q \\cdot \\frac{L}{n+k}+1$.\n\nThen, since $n+1 \\leqslant 2^{c}=n+\\ell \\leqslant 2 n+1 \\leqslant 2^{c+1}-1$, we have $2^{c} \\mid L$, but $2^{c+1} \\nmid L$. So $\\frac{L}{n+\\ell}$ is odd, while $\\frac{L}{n+k}$ is even for $k \\neq \\ell$. Computing modulo $2 q$ yields\n\n$$\nx_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{n+1}-1 \\equiv(q+1) \\cdot 1^{n}-1 \\equiv q \\quad(\\bmod 2 q) .\n$$\n\nThus, $x_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{n+1}-1=2 q r+q=q(2 r+1)$ for some integer $r$.\n\nSince $x_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{n+1}-1 \\geqslant x_{1} x_{2}-1 \\geqslant(q+1)^{2}-1>q$, we have $r \\geqslant 1$. This implies that $x_{1} x_{2} \\cdots x_{n+1}-1$ is divisible by an odd prime."
