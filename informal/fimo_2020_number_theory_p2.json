    "informal_statement": "For each prime $p$, there is a kingdom of $p$-Landia consisting of $p$ islands numbered $1,2, \\ldots, p$. Two distinct islands numbered $n$ and $m$ are connected by a bridge if and only if $p$ divides $\\left(n^{2}-m+1\\right)\\left(m^{2}-n+1\\right)$. The bridges may pass over each other, but cannot cross. Prove that for infinitely many $p$ there are two islands in $p$-Landia not connected by a chain of bridges.",
    "informal_proof": "We prove that for each prime $p>3$ dividing a number of the form $x^{2}-x+1$ with integer $x$ there are two unconnected islands in $p$-Landia.\n\nFor brevity's sake, when a bridge connects the islands numbered $m$ and $n$, we shall speak simply that it connects $m$ and $n$.\n\nA bridge connects $m$ and $n$ if $n \\equiv m^{2}+1(\\bmod p)$ or $m \\equiv n^{2}+1(\\bmod p)$. If $m^{2}+1 \\equiv n$ $(\\bmod p)$, we draw an arrow starting at $m$ on the bridge connecting $m$ and $n$. Clearly only one arrow starts at $m$ if $m^{2}+1 \\not \\equiv m(\\bmod p)$, and no arrows otherwise. The total number of bridges does not exceed the total number of arrows.\n\nSuppose $x^{2}-x+1 \\equiv 0(\\bmod p)$. We may assume that $1 \\leqslant x \\leqslant p$; then there is no arrow starting at $x$. Since $(1-x)^{2}-(1-x)+1=x^{2}-x+1,(p+1-x)^{2}+1 \\equiv(p+1-x)(\\bmod p)$, and there is also no arrow starting at $p+1-x$. If $x=p+1-x$, that is, $x=\\frac{p+1}{2}$, then $4\\left(x^{2}-x+1\\right)=p^{2}+3$ and therefore $x^{2}-x+1$ is not divisible by $p$. Thus the islands $x$ and $p+1-x$ are different, and no arrows start at either of them. It follows that the total number of bridges in $p$-Landia does not exceed $p-2$.\n\nLet $1,2, \\ldots, p$ be the vertices of a graph $G_{p}$, where an edge connects $m$ and $n$ if and only if there is a bridge between $m$ and $n$. The number of vertices of $G_{p}$ is $p$ and the number of edges is less than $p-1$. This means that the graph is not connected, which means that there are two islands not connected by a chain of bridges.\n\nIt remains to prove that there are infinitely many primes $p$ dividing $x^{2}-x+1$ for some integer $x$. Let $p_{1}, p_{2}, \\ldots, p_{k}$ be any finite set of such primes. The number $\\left(p_{1} p_{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_{k}\\right)^{2}-p_{1} p_{2} \\cdot \\ldots \\cdot p_{k}+1$ is greater than 1 and not divisible by any $p_{i}$; therefore it has another prime divisor with the required property."
