{"problem_name": "imosl_2008_algebra_p2_2", "informal_statement": "$$\n\\frac{x^{2}}{(x-1)^{2}}+\\frac{y^{2}}{(y-1)^{2}}+\\frac{z^{2}}{(z-1)^{2}} \\geq 1\n$$\n\nfor real numbers $x, y, z \\neq 1$ satisfying the condition $x y z=1$.\n\nShow that there are infinitely many triples of rational numbers $x, y, z$ for which this inequality turns into equality.", "informal_proof": "From the equation $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}-1=(a+b+c-1)^{2}$ we see that the proposed inequality becomes an equality if and only if both sums $a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}$ and $a+b+c$ have value 1 . The first of them is equal to $(a+b+c)^{2}-2(a b+b c+c a)$. So the instances of equality are described by the system of two equations\n\n$$\na+b+c=1, \\quad a b+b c+c a=0\n$$\n\nplus the constraint $a, b, c \\neq 1$. Elimination of $c$ leads to $a^{2}+a b+b^{2}=a+b$, which we regard as a quadratic equation in $b$,\n\n$$\nb^{2}+(a-1) b+a(a-1)=0\n$$\n\nwith discriminant\n\n$$\n\\Delta=(a-1)^{2}-4 a(a-1)=(1-a)(1+3 a) .\n$$\n\nWe are looking for rational triples $(a, b, c)$; it will suffice to have $a$ rational such that $1-a$ and $1+3 a$ are both squares of rational numbers (then $\\Delta$ will be so too). Set $a=k / m$. We want $m-k$ and $m+3 k$ to be squares of integers. This is achieved for instance by taking $m=k^{2}-k+1$ (clearly nonzero); then $m-k=(k-1)^{2}, m+3 k=(k+1)^{2}$. Note that distinct integers $k$ yield distinct values of $a=k / m$.\n\nAnd thus, if $k$ is any integer and $m=k^{2}-k+1, a=k / m$ then $\\Delta=\\left(k^{2}-1\\right)^{2} / m^{2}$ and the quadratic equation has rational roots $b=\\left(m-k \\pm k^{2} \\mp 1\\right) /(2 m)$. Choose e.g. the larger root,\n\n$$\nb=\\frac{m-k+k^{2}-1}{2 m}=\\frac{m+(m-2)}{2 m}=\\frac{m-1}{m} .\n$$\n\nComputing $c$ from $a+b+c=1$ then gives $c=(1-k) / m$. The condition $a, b, c \\neq 1$ eliminates only $k=0$ and $k=1$. Thus, as $k$ varies over integers greater than 1 , we obtain an infinite family of rational triples $(a, b, c)$-and coming back to the original variables $(x=a /(a-1)$ etc. $)$ - an infinite family of rational triples $(x, y, z)$ with the needed property. (A short calculation shows that the resulting triples are $x=-k /(k-1)^{2}, y=k-k^{2}, z=(k-1) / k^{2}$; but the proof was complete without listing them.)"}
