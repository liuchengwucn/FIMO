    "informal_statement": "A positive integer $N$ is called balanced, if $N=1$ or if $N$ can be written as a product of an even number of not necessarily distinct primes. Given positive integers $a$ and $b$, consider the polynomial $P$ defined by $P(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$.\n\nProve that there exist distinct positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that all the numbers $P(1), P(2)$, $\\ldots, P(50)$ are balanced.",
    "informal_proof": "Define a function $f$ on the set of positive integers by $f(n)=0$ if $n$ is balanced and $f(n)=1$ otherwise. Clearly, $f(n m) \\equiv f(n)+f(m) \\bmod 2$ for all positive integers $n, m$.\n\nNow for each positive integer $n$ consider the binary sequence $(f(n+1), f(n+2), \\ldots, f(n+$ 50)). As there are only $2^{50}$ different such sequences there are two different positive integers $a$ and $b$ such that\n\n$$\n(f(a+1), f(a+2), \\ldots, f(a+50))=(f(b+1), f(b+2), \\ldots, f(b+50)) .\n$$\n\nBut this implies that for the polynomial $P(x)=(x+a)(x+b)$ all the numbers $P(1), P(2)$, $\\ldots, P(50)$ are balanced, since for all $1 \\leq k \\leq 50$ we have $f(P(k)) \\equiv f(a+k)+f(b+k) \\equiv$ $2 f(a+k) \\equiv 0 \\bmod 2$."
