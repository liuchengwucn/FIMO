    "informal_statement": "Let $P$ be a polynomial of degree $n>1$ with integer coefficients and let $k$ be any positive integer. Consider the polynomial $Q(x)=P(P(\\ldots P(P(x)) \\ldots))$, with $k$ pairs of parentheses. Prove that $Q$ has no more than $n$ integer fixed points, i.e. integers satisfying the equation $Q(x)=x$",
    "informal_proof": "The claim is obvious if every integer fixed point of $Q$ is a fixed point of $P$ itself. For the sequel assume that this is not the case. Take any integer $x_{0}$ such that $Q\\left(x_{0}\\right)=x_{0}$, $P\\left(x_{0}\\right) \\neq x_{0}$ and define inductively $x_{i+1}=P\\left(x_{i}\\right)$ for $i=0,1,2, \\ldots ;$ then $x_{k}=x_{0}$.\n\nIt is evident that\n\n$$\nP(u)-P(v) \\text { is divisible by } u-v \\text { for distinct integers } u, v \\text {. }\n$$\n\n(Indeed, if $P(x)=\\sum a_{i} x^{i}$ then each $a_{i}\\left(u^{i}-v^{i}\\right)$ is divisible by $u-v$.) Therefore each term in the chain of (nonzero) differences\n\n$$\nx_{0}-x_{1}, \\quad x_{1}-x_{2}, \\quad \\ldots, \\quad x_{k-1}-x_{k}, \\quad x_{k}-x_{k+1}\n$$\n\nis a divisor of the next one; and since $x_{k}-x_{k+1}=x_{0}-x_{1}$, all these differences have equal absolute values. For $x_{m}=\\min \\left(x_{1}, \\ldots, x_{k}\\right)$ this means that $x_{m-1}-x_{m}=-\\left(x_{m}-x_{m+1}\\right)$. Thus $x_{m-1}=x_{m+1}\\left(\\neq x_{m}\\right)$. It follows that consecutive differences in the sequence (2) have opposite signs. Consequently, $x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \\ldots$ is an alternating sequence of two distinct values. In other words, every integer fixed point of $Q$ is a fixed point of the polynomial $P(P(x))$. Our task is to prove that there are at most $n$ such points.\n\nLet $a$ be one of them so that $b=P(a) \\neq a$ (we have assumed that such an $a$ exists); then $a=P(b)$. Take any other integer fixed point $\\alpha$ of $P(P(x))$ and let $P(\\alpha)=\\beta$, so that $P(\\beta)=\\alpha$; the numbers $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ need not be distinct ( $\\alpha$ can be a fixed point of $P$ ), but each of $\\alpha, \\beta$ is different from each of $a, b$. Applying property (1) to the four pairs of integers $(\\alpha, a),(\\beta, b)$, $(\\alpha, b),(\\beta, a)$ we get that the numbers $\\alpha-a$ and $\\beta-b$ divide each other, and also $\\alpha-b$ and $\\beta-a$ divide each other. Consequently\n\n$$\n\\alpha-b=\\pm(\\beta-a), \\quad \\alpha-a=\\pm(\\beta-b) .\n$$\n\nSuppose we have a plus in both instances: $\\alpha-b=\\beta-a$ and $\\alpha-a=\\beta-b$. Subtraction yields $a-b=b-a$, a contradiction, as $a \\neq b$. Therefore at least one equality in (3) holds with a minus sign. For each of them this means that $\\alpha+\\beta=a+b$; equivalently $a+b-\\alpha-P(\\alpha)=0$.\n\nDenote $a+b$ by $C$. We have shown that every integer fixed point of $Q$ other that $a$ and $b$ is a root of the polynomial $F(x)=C-x-P(x)$. This is of course true for $a$ and $b$ as well. And since $P$ has degree $n>1$, the polynomial $F$ has the same degree, so it cannot have more than $n$ roots. Hence the result."
