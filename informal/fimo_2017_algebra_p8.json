    "informal_statement": "Assume that a function $f: \\mathbb{R} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}$ satisfies the following condition:\n\nFor every $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $(f(x)+y)(f(y)+x)>0$, we have $f(x)+y=f(y)+x$.\n\nProve that $f(x)+y \\leqslant f(y)+x$ whenever $x>y$.",
    "informal_proof": "Define $g(x)=x-f(x)$. The condition on $f$ then rewrites as follows:\n\nFor every $x, y \\in \\mathbb{R}$ such that $((x+y)-g(x))((x+y)-g(y))>0$, we have $g(x)=g(y)$.\n\nThis condition may in turn be rewritten in the following form:\n\nIf $g(x) \\neq g(y)$, then the number $x+y$ lies (non-strictly) between $g(x)$ and $g(y)$.\n\nNotice here that the function $g_{1}(x)=-g(-x)$ also satisfies $(*)$, since\n\n$g_{1}(x) \\neq g_{1}(y) \\Longrightarrow g(-x) \\neq g(-y) \\quad \\Longrightarrow \\quad-(x+y)$ lies between $g(-x)$ and $g(-y)$\n\n$\\Longrightarrow \\quad x+y$ lies between $g_{1}(x)$ and $g_{1}(y)$.\n\nOn the other hand, the relation we need to prove reads now as\n\n$$\ng(x) \\leqslant g(y) \\quad \\text { whenever } x<y .\n$$\n\nAgain, this condition is equivalent to the same one with $g$ replaced by $g_{1}$.\n\nIf $g(x)=2 x$ for all $x \\in \\mathbb{R}$, then $(*)$ is obvious; so in what follows we consider the other case. We split the solution into a sequence of lemmas, strengthening one another. We always consider some value of $x$ with $g(x) \\neq 2 x$ and denote $X=g(x)$.\n\nLemma 1. Assume that $X<2 x$. Then on the interval $(X-x ; x]$ the function $g$ attains at most two values - namely, $X$ and, possibly, some $Y>X$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g$ attains at most two values on $[x ; X-x)$ - namely, $X$ and, possibly, some $Y<X$.\n\nProof. We start with the first claim of the lemma. Notice that $X-x<x$, so the considered interval is nonempty.\n\nTake any $a \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(a) \\neq X$ (if it exists). If $g(a)<X$, then $(*)$ yields $g(a) \\leqslant$ $a+x \\leqslant g(x)=X$, so $a \\leqslant X-x$ which is impossible. Thus, $g(a)>X$ and hence by $(*)$ we get $X \\leqslant a+x \\leqslant g(a)$.\n\nNow, for any $b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(b) \\neq X$ we similarly get $b+x \\leqslant g(b)$. Therefore, the number $a+b$ (which is smaller than each of $a+x$ and $b+x)$ cannot lie between $g(a)$ and $g(b)$, which by $(*)$ implies that $g(a)=g(b)$. Hence $g$ may attain only two values on $(X-x ; x]$, namely $X$ and $g(a)>X$.\n\nTo prove the second claim, notice that $g_{1}(-x)=-X<2 \\cdot(-x)$, so $g_{1}$ attains at most two values on $(-X+x,-x]$, i.e., $-X$ and, possibly, some $-Y>-X$. Passing back to $g$, we get what we need.\n\nLemma 2. If $X<2 x$, then $g$ is constant on $(X-x ; x)$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g$ is constant on $(x ; X-x)$.\n\nProof. Again, it suffices to prove the first claim only. Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that there exist $a, b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $g(a) \\neq g(b)$; by Lemma 1 , we may assume that $g(a)=X$ and $Y=g(b)>X$.\n\nNotice that $\\min \\{X-a, X-b\\}>X-x$, so there exists a $u \\in(X-x ; x)$ such that $u<\\min \\{X-a, X-b\\}$. By Lemma 1, we have either $g(u)=X$ or $g(u)=Y$. In the former case, by $(*)$ we have $X \\leqslant u+b \\leqslant Y$ which contradicts $u<X-b$. In the second case, by $(*)$ we have $X \\leqslant u+a \\leqslant Y$ which contradicts $u<X-a$. Thus the lemma is proved. Lemma 3. If $X<2 x$, then $g(a)=X$ for all $a \\in(X-x ; x)$. Similarly, if $X>2 x$, then $g(a)=X$ for all $a \\in(x ; X-x)$.\n\nProof. Again, we only prove the first claim.\n\nBy Lemmas 1 and 2, this claim may be violated only if $g$ takes on a constant value $Y>X$ on $(X-x, x)$. Choose any $a, b \\in(X-x ; x)$ with $a<b$. By $(*)$, we have\n\n$$\nY \\geqslant b+x \\geqslant X\n$$\n\nIn particular, we have $Y \\geqslant b+x>2 a$. Applying Lemma 2 to $a$ in place of $x$, we obtain that $g$ is constant on $(a, Y-a)$. By (2) again, we have $x \\leqslant Y-b<Y-a$; so $x, b \\in(a ; Y-a)$. But $X=g(x) \\neq g(b)=Y$, which is a contradiction.\n\nNow we are able to finish the solution. Assume that $g(x)>g(y)$ for some $x<y$. Denote $X=g(x)$ and $Y=g(y)$; by $(*)$, we have $X \\geqslant x+y \\geqslant Y$, so $Y-y \\leqslant x<y \\leqslant X-x$, and hence $(Y-y ; y) \\cap(x ; X-x)=(x, y) \\neq \\varnothing$. On the other hand, since $Y-y<y$ and $x<X-x$, Lemma 3 shows that $g$ should attain a constant value $X$ on $(x ; X-x)$ and a constant value $Y \\neq X$ on $(Y-y ; y)$. Since these intervals overlap, we get the final contradiction."
