    "informal_statement": "Let $n$ be a positive integer and let $p$ be a prime number. Prove that if $a, b, c$ are integers (not necessarily positive) satisfying the equations\n\n$$\na^{n}+p b=b^{n}+p c=c^{n}+p a,\n$$\n\nthen $a=b=c$.",
    "informal_proof": "If two of $a, b, c$ are equal, it is immediate that all the three are equal. So we may assume that $a \\neq b \\neq c \\neq a$. Subtracting the equations we get $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ and two cyclic copies of this equation, which upon multiplication yield\n\n$$\n\\frac{a^{n}-b^{n}}{a-b} \\cdot \\frac{b^{n}-c^{n}}{b-c} \\cdot \\frac{c^{n}-a^{n}}{c-a}=-p^{3} .\n$$\n\nIf $n$ is odd then the differences $a^{n}-b^{n}$ and $a-b$ have the same sign and the product on the left is positive, while $-p^{3}$ is negative. So $n$ must be even.\n\nLet $d$ be the greatest common divisor of the three differences $a-b, b-c, c-a$, so that $a-b=d u, b-c=d v, \\quad c-a=d w ; \\operatorname{gcd}(u, v, w)=1, \\quad u+v+w=0$.\n\nFrom $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ we see that $(a-b) \\mid p(b-c)$, i.e., $u \\mid p v$; and cyclically $v|p w, w| p u$. As $\\operatorname{gcd}(u, v, w)=1$ and $u+v+w=0$, at most one of $u, v$, w can be divisible by $p$. Supposing that the prime $p$ does not divide any one of them, we get $u|v, v| w, w \\mid u$, whence $|u|=|v|=|w|=1$; but this quarrels with $u+v+w=0$.\n\nThus $p$ must divide exactly one of these numbers. Let e.g. $p \\mid u$ and write $u=p u_{1}$. Now we obtain, similarly as before, $u_{1}|v, v| w, w \\mid u_{1}$ so that $\\left|u_{1}\\right|=|v|=|w|=1$. The equation $p u_{1}+v+w=0$ forces that the prime $p$ must be even; i.e. $p=2$. Hence $v+w=-2 u_{1}=\\pm 2$, implying $v=w(=\\pm 1)$ and $u=-2 v$. Consequently $a-b=-2(b-c)$.\n\nKnowing that $n$ is even, say $n=2 k$, we rewrite the equation $a^{n}-b^{n}=-p(b-c)$ with $p=2$ in the form\n\n$$\n\\left(a^{k}+b^{k}\\right)\\left(a^{k}-b^{k}\\right)=-2(b-c)=a-b .\n$$\n\nThe second factor on the left is divisible by $a-b$, so the first factor $\\left(a^{k}+b^{k}\\right)$ must be $\\pm 1$. Then exactly one of $a$ and $b$ must be odd; yet $a-b=-2(b-c)$ is even. Contradiction ends the proof."
