    "informal_statement": "Let $n \\geqslant 3$ be a positive integer and let $\\left(a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}\\right)$ be a strictly increasing sequence of $n$ positive real numbers with sum equal to 2. Let $X$ be a subset of $\\{1,2, \\ldots, n\\}$ such that the value of\n\n$$\n\\left|1-\\sum_{i \\in X} a_{i}\\right|\n$$\n\nis minimised. Prove that there exists a strictly increasing sequence of $n$ positive real numbers $\\left(b_{1}, b_{2}, \\ldots, b_{n}\\right)$ with sum equal to 2 such that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in X} b_{i}=1\n$$",
    "informal_proof": "In all solutions, we say an index set $X$ is $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$-minimising if it has the property in the problem for the given sequence $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$. Write $X^{c}$ for the complement of $X$, and $[a, b]$ for the interval of integers $k$ such that $a \\leqslant k \\leqslant b$. Note that\n\n$$\n\\left|1-\\sum_{i \\in X} a_{i}\\right|=\\left|1-\\sum_{i \\in X^{c}} a_{i}\\right|,\n$$\n\nso we may exchange $X$ and $X^{c}$ where convenient. Let\n\n$$\n\\Delta=\\sum_{i \\in X^{c}} a_{i}-\\sum_{i \\in X} a_{i}\n$$\n\nand note that $X$ is $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$-minimising if and only if it minimises $|\\Delta|$, and that $\\sum_{i \\in X} a_{i}=1$ if and only if $\\Delta=0$.\n\nIn some solutions, a scaling process is used. If we have a strictly increasing sequence of positive real numbers $c_{i}$ (typically obtained by perturbing the $a_{i}$ in some way) such that\n\n$$\n\\sum_{i \\in X} c_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in X^{c}} c_{i}\n$$\n\nthen we may put $b_{i}=2 c_{i} / \\sum_{j=1}^{n} c_{j}$. So it suffices to construct such a sequence without needing its sum to be 2 .\n\nThe solutions below show various possible approaches to the problem. Solutions 1 and 2 perturb a few of the $a_{i}$ to form the $b_{i}$ (with scaling in the case of Solution 1 , without scaling in the case of Solution 2). Solutions 3 and 4 look at properties of the index set $X$. Solution 3 then perturbs many of the $a_{i}$ to form the $b_{i}$, together with scaling. Rather than using such perturbations, Solution 4 constructs a sequence $\\left(b_{i}\\right)$ directly from the set $X$ with the required properties. Solution 4 can be used to give a complete description of sets $X$ that are $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$-minimising for some $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$.\n\nWithout loss of generality, assume $\\sum_{i \\in X} a_{i} \\leqslant 1$, and we may assume strict inequality as otherwise $b_{i}=a_{i}$ works. Also, $X$ clearly cannot be empty.\n\nIf $n \\in X$, add $\\Delta$ to $a_{n}$, producing a sequence of $c_{i}$ with $\\sum_{i \\in X} c_{i}=\\sum_{i \\in X^{c}} c_{i}$, and then scale as described above to make the sum equal to 2. Otherwise, there is some $k$ with $k \\in X$ and $k+1 \\in X^{c}$. Let $\\delta=a_{k+1}-a_{k}$.\n\n\\begin{itemize}\n  \\item If $\\delta>\\Delta$, add $\\Delta$ to $a_{k}$ and then scale.\n\n  \\item If $\\delta<\\Delta$, then considering $X \\cup\\{k+1\\} \\backslash\\{k\\}$ contradicts $X$ being $\\left(a_{i}\\right)$-minimising.\n\n  \\item If $\\delta=\\Delta$, choose any $j \\neq k, k+1$ (possible since $n \\geqslant 3$ ), and any $\\epsilon$ less than the least of $a_{1}$ and all the differences $a_{i+1}-a_{i}$. If $j \\in X$ then add $\\Delta-\\epsilon$ to $a_{k}$ and $\\epsilon$ to $a_{j}$, then scale; otherwise, add $\\Delta$ to $a_{k}$ and $\\epsilon / 2$ to $a_{k+1}$, and subtract $\\epsilon / 2$ from $a_{j}$, then scale.\n\n\\end{itemize}\n"
