    "informal_statement": "Let $a, b$ be integers, and let $P(x)=a x^{3}+b x$. For any positive integer $n$ we say that the pair $(a, b)$ is $n$-good if $n \\mid P(m)-P(k)$ implies $n \\mid m-k$ for all integers $m, k$. We say that $(a, b)$ is very good if $(a, b)$ is $n$-good for infinitely many positive integers $n$.\n\nFind a pair $(a, b)$ which is 51 -good, but not very good.\n\nThe final answer is the pair $\\left(1,-51^{2}\\right)$.",
    "informal_proof": "We show that the pair $\\left(1,-51^{2}\\right)$ is good but not very good. Let $P(x)=x^{3}-51^{2} x$. Since $P(51)=P(0)$, the pair $\\left(1,-51^{2}\\right)$ is not $n$-good for any positive integer that does not divide 51 . Therefore, $\\left(1,-51^{2}\\right)$ is not very good.\n\nOn the other hand, if $P(m) \\equiv P(k)(\\bmod 51)$, then $m^{3} \\equiv k^{3}(\\bmod 51)$. By Fermat's theorem, from this we obtain\n\n$$\nm \\equiv m^{3} \\equiv k^{3} \\equiv k \\quad(\\bmod 3) \\quad \\text { and } \\quad m \\equiv m^{33} \\equiv k^{33} \\equiv k \\quad(\\bmod 17) .\n$$\n\nHence we have $m \\equiv k(\\bmod 51)$. Therefore $\\left(1,-51^{2}\\right)$ is 51 -good."
