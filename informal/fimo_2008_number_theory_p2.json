    "informal_statement": "Let $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ be distinct positive integers, $n \\geq 3$. Prove that there exist distinct indices $i$ and $j$ such that $a_{i}+a_{j}$ does not divide any of the numbers $3 a_{1}, 3 a_{2}, \\ldots, 3 a_{n}$.",
    "informal_proof": "Without loss of generality, let $0<a_{1}<a_{2}<\\cdots<a_{n}$. One can also assume that $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ are coprime. Otherwise division by their greatest common divisor reduces the question to the new sequence whose terms are coprime integers.\n\nSuppose that the claim is false. Then for each $i<n$ there exists a $j$ such that $a_{n}+a_{i}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. If $a_{n}+a_{i}$ is not divisible by 3 then $a_{n}+a_{i}$ divides $a_{j}$ which is impossible as $0<a_{j} \\leq a_{n}<a_{n}+a_{i}$. Thus $a_{n}+a_{i}$ is a multiple of 3 for $i=1, \\ldots, n-1$, so that $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}$ are all congruent (to $\\left.-a_{n}\\right)$ modulo 3 .\n\nNow $a_{n}$ is not divisible by 3 or else so would be all remaining $a_{i}$ 's, meaning that $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{n}$ are not coprime. Hence $a_{n} \\equiv r(\\bmod 3)$ where $r \\in\\{1,2\\}$, and $a_{i} \\equiv 3-r(\\bmod 3)$ for all $i=1, \\ldots, n-1$.\n\nConsider a sum $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ where $1 \\leq i \\leq n-2$. There is at least one such sum as $n \\geq 3$. Let $j$ be an index such that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. Observe that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ is not divisible by 3 since $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \\equiv 2 a_{i} \\not \\equiv 0(\\bmod 3)$. It follows that $a_{n-1}+a_{i}$ divides $a_{j}$, in particular $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \\leq a_{j}$. Hence $a_{n-1}<a_{j} \\leq a_{n}$, implying $j=n$. So $a_{n}$ is divisible by all sums $a_{n-1}+a_{i}, 1 \\leq i \\leq n-2$. In particular $a_{n-1}+a_{i} \\leq a_{n}$ for $i=1, \\ldots, n-2$.\n\nLet $j$ be such that $a_{n}+a_{n-1}$ divides $3 a_{j}$. If $j \\leq n-2$ then $a_{n}+a_{n-1} \\leq 3 a_{j}<a_{j}+2 a_{n-1}$. This yields $a_{n}<a_{n-1}+a_{j}$; however $a_{n-1}+a_{j} \\leq a_{n}$ for $j \\leq n-2$. Therefore $j=n-1$ or $j=n$.\n\nFor $j=n-1$ we obtain $3 a_{n-1}=k\\left(a_{n}+a_{n-1}\\right)$ with $k$ an integer, and it is straightforward that $k=1\\left(k \\leq 0\\right.$ and $k \\geq 3$ contradict $0<a_{n-1}<a_{n} ; k=2$ leads to $\\left.a_{n-1}=2 a_{n}>a_{n-1}\\right)$. Thus $3 a_{n-1}=a_{n}+a_{n-1}$, i. e. $a_{n}=2 a_{n-1}$.\n\nSimilarly, if $j=n$ then $3 a_{n}=k\\left(a_{n}+a_{n-1}\\right)$ for some integer $k$, and only $k=2$ is possible. Hence $a_{n}=2 a_{n-1}$ holds true in both cases remaining, $j=n-1$ and $j=n$.\n\nNow $a_{n}=2 a_{n-1}$ implies that the sum $a_{n-1}+a_{1}$ is strictly between $a_{n} / 2$ and $a_{n}$. But $a_{n-1}$ and $a_{1}$ are distinct as $n \\geq 3$, so it follows from the above that $a_{n-1}+a_{1}$ divides $a_{n}$. This provides the desired contradiction."
