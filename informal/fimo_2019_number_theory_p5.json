    "informal_statement": "Let $a$ be a positive integer. We say that a positive integer $b$ is $a-\\operatorname{good}$ if $\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)-1$ is divisible by $a n+1$ for all positive integers $n$ with $a n \\geqslant b$. Suppose $b$ is a positive integer such that $b$ is $a$-good, but $b+2$ is not $a$-good. Prove that $b+1$ is prime.",
    "informal_proof": "For $p$ a prime and $n$ a nonzero integer, we write $v_{p}(n)$ for the $p$-adic valuation of $n$ : the largest integer $t$ such that $p^{t} \\mid n$.\n\nWe first show that $b$ is $a$-good if and only if $b$ is even, and $p \\mid a$ for all primes $p \\leqslant b$.\n\nTo start with, the condition that $a n+1 \\mid\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)-1$ can be rewritten as saying that\n\n$$\n\\frac{a n(a n-1) \\cdots(a n-b+1)}{b !} \\equiv 1 \\quad(\\bmod a n+1)\n$$\n\nSuppose, on the one hand, there is a prime $p \\leqslant b$ with $p \\nmid a$. Take $t=v_{p}(b !)$. Then there exist positive integers $c$ such that $a c \\equiv 1\\left(\\bmod p^{t+1}\\right)$. If we take $c$ big enough, and then take $n=(p-1) c$, then $a n=a(p-1) c \\equiv p-1\\left(\\bmod p^{t+1}\\right)$ and $a n \\geqslant b$. Since $p \\leqslant b$, one of the terms of the numerator an $(a n-1) \\cdots(a n-b+1)$ is an $-p+1$, which is divisible by $p^{t+1}$. Hence the $p$-adic valuation of the numerator is at least $t+1$, but that of the denominator is exactly $t$. This means that $p \\mid\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)$, so $p \\nmid\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)-1$. As $p \\mid a n+1$, we get that $a n+1 \\nmid\\left(\\begin{array}{c}a n \\\\ b\\end{array}\\right)$, so $b$ is not $a-g o o d$.\n\nOn the other hand, if for all primes $p \\leqslant b$ we have $p \\mid a$, then every factor of $b$ ! is coprime to $a n+1$, and hence invertible modulo $a n+1$ : hence $b$ ! is also invertible modulo $a n+1$. Then equation (1) reduces to:\n\n$$\na n(a n-1) \\cdots(a n-b+1) \\equiv b ! \\quad(\\bmod a n+1)\n$$\n\nHowever, we can rewrite the left-hand side as follows:\n\n$$\n\\operatorname{an}(a n-1) \\cdots(a n-b+1) \\equiv(-1)(-2) \\cdots(-b) \\equiv(-1)^{b} b ! \\quad(\\bmod a n+1) .\n$$\n\nProvided that an $>1$, if $b$ is even we deduce $(-1)^{b} b ! \\equiv b$ ! as needed. On the other hand, if $b$ is odd, and we take $a n+1>2(b !)$, then we will not have $(-1)^{b} b ! \\equiv b$ !, so $b$ is not $a$-good. This completes the claim.\n\nTo conclude from here, suppose that $b$ is $a$-good, but $b+2$ is not. Then $b$ is even, and $p \\mid a$ for all primes $p \\leqslant b$, but there is a prime $q \\leqslant b+2$ for which $q \\nmid a$ : so $q=b+1$ or $q=b+2$. We cannot have $q=b+2$, as that is even too, so we have $q=b+1$ : in other words, $b+1$ is prime."
