    "informal_statement": "Let $P(x)$ be a non-constant polynomial with integer coefficients. Prove that there is no function $T$ from the set of integers into the set of integers such that the number of integers $x$ with $T^{n}(x)=x$ is equal to $P(n)$ for every $n \\geq 1$, where $T^{n}$ denotes the $n$-fold application of $T$.",
    "informal_proof": "Assume there is a polynomial $P$ of degree at least 1 with the desired property for a given function $T$. Let $A(n)$ denote the set of all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ such that $T^{n}(x)=x$ and let $B(n)$ denote the set of all $x \\in \\mathbb{Z}$ for which $T^{n}(x)=x$ and $T^{k}(x) \\neq x$ for all $1 \\leq k<n$. Both sets are finite under the assumption made. For each $x \\in A(n)$ there is a smallest $k \\geq 1$ such that $T^{k}(x)=x$, i.e., $x \\in B(k)$. Let $d=\\operatorname{gcd}(k, n)$. There are positive integers $r, s$ such that $r k-s n=d$ and hence $x=T^{r k}(x)=T^{s n+d}(x)=T^{d}\\left(T^{s n}(x)\\right)=T^{d}(x)$. The minimality of $k$ implies $d=k$, i.e., $k \\mid n$. On the other hand one clearly has $B(k) \\subset A(n)$ if $k \\mid n$ and thus we have $A(n)=\\bigcup_{d \\mid n} B(d)$ as a disjoint union and hence\n\n$$\n|A(n)|=\\sum_{d \\mid n}|B(d)| .\n$$\n\nFurthermore, for every $x \\in B(n)$ the elements $x, T^{1}(x), T^{2}(x), \\ldots, T^{n-1}(x)$ are $n$ distinct elements of $B(n)$. The fact that they are in $A(n)$ is obvious. If for some $k<n$ and some $0 \\leq i<n$ we had $T^{k}\\left(T^{i}(x)\\right)=T^{i}(x)$, i.e. $T^{k+i}(x)=T^{i}(x)$, that would imply $x=T^{n}(x)=T^{n-i}\\left(T^{i}(x)\\right)=T^{n-i}\\left(T^{k+i}(x)\\right)=T^{k}\\left(T^{n}(x)\\right)=T^{k}(x)$ contradicting the minimality of $n$. Thus $T^{i}(x) \\in B(n)$ and $T^{i}(x) \\neq T^{j}(x)$ for $0 \\leq i<j \\leq n-1$.\n\nSo indeed, $T$ permutes the elements of $B(n)$ in (disjoint) cycles of length $n$ and in particular one has $n|| B(n) \\mid$.\n\nNow let $P(x)=\\sum_{i=0}^{k} a_{i} x^{i}, a_{i} \\in \\mathbb{Z}, k \\geq 1, a_{k} \\neq 0$ and suppose that $|A(n)|=P(n)$ for all $n \\geq 1$. Let $p$ be any prime. Then\n\n$$\np^{2}|| B\\left(p^{2}\\right)|=| A\\left(p^{2}\\right)|-| A(p) \\mid=a_{1}\\left(p^{2}-p\\right)+a_{2}\\left(p^{4}-p^{2}\\right)+\\ldots\n$$\n\nHence $p \\mid a_{1}$ and since this is true for all primes we must have $a_{1}=0$.\n\nNow consider any two different primes $p$ and $q$. Since $a_{1}=0$ we have that\n\n$$\n\\left|A\\left(p^{2} q\\right)\\right|-|A(p q)|=a_{2}\\left(p^{4} q^{2}-p^{2} q^{2}\\right)+a_{3}\\left(p^{6} q^{3}-p^{3} q^{3}\\right)+\\ldots\n$$\n\nis a multiple of $p^{2} q$. But we also have\n\n$$\np^{2} q|| B\\left(p^{2} q\\right)|=| A\\left(p^{2} q\\right)|-| A(p q)|-| B\\left(p^{2}\\right) \\mid .\n$$\n\nThis implies\n\n$$\np^{2} q|| B\\left(p^{2}\\right)|=| A\\left(p^{2}\\right)|-| A(p) \\mid=a_{2}\\left(p^{4}-p^{2}\\right)+a_{3}\\left(p^{6}-p^{3}\\right)+\\cdots+a_{k}\\left(p^{2 k}-p^{k}\\right) .\n$$\n\nSince this is true for every prime $q$ we must have $a_{2}\\left(p^{4}-p^{2}\\right)+a_{3}\\left(p^{6}-p^{3}\\right)+\\cdots+a_{k}\\left(p^{2 k}-p^{k}\\right)=0$ for every prime $p$. Since this expression is a polynomial in $p$ of degree $2 k$ (because $\\left.a_{k} \\neq 0\\right)$ this is a contradiction, as such a polynomial can have at most $2 k$ zeros."
