    "informal_statement": "Define the sequence $a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots$ by $a_{n}=2^{n}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}$. Prove that there are infinitely many terms of the sequence which can be expressed as a sum of (two or more) distinct terms of the sequence, as well as infinitely many of those which cannot be expressed in such a way.",
    "informal_proof": "Call a nonnegative integer representable if it equals the sum of several (possibly 0 or 1 ) distinct terms of the sequence. We say that two nonnegative integers $b$ and $c$ are equivalent (written as $b \\sim c$ ) if they are either both representable or both non-representable.\n\nOne can easily compute\n\n$$\nS_{n-1}:=a_{0}+\\cdots+a_{n-1}=2^{n}+2^{\\lceil n / 2]}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2]}-3 .\n$$\n\nIndeed, we have $S_{n}-S_{n-1}=2^{n}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}=a_{n}$ so we can use the induction. In particular, $S_{2 k-1}=2^{2 k}+2^{k+1}-3$\n\nNote that, if $n \\geqslant 3$, then $2^{[n / 2]} \\geqslant 2^{2}>3$, so\n\n$$\nS_{n-1}=2^{n}+2^{[n / 2]}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}-3>2^{n}+2^{\\lfloor n / 2\\rfloor}=a_{n} .\n$$\n\nAlso notice that $S_{n-1}-a_{n}=2^{\\lceil n / 2]}-3<a_{n}$.\n\nThe main tool of the solution is the following claim.\n\nClaim 1. Assume that $b$ is a positive integer such that $S_{n-1}-a_{n}<b<a_{n}$ for some $n \\geqslant 3$. Then $b \\sim S_{n-1}-b$.\n\nProof. As seen above, we have $S_{n-1}>a_{n}$. Denote $c=S_{n-1}-b$; then $S_{n-1}-a_{n}<c<a_{n}$, so the roles of $b$ and $c$ are symmetrical.\n\nAssume that $b$ is representable. The representation cannot contain $a_{i}$ with $i \\geqslant n$, since $b<a_{n}$. So $b$ is the sum of some subset of $\\left\\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$; then $c$ is the sum of the complement. The converse is obtained by swapping $b$ and $c$.\n\nWe also need the following version of this claim.\n\nClaim 2. For any $n \\geqslant 3$, the number $a_{n}$ can be represented as a sum of two or more distinct terms of the sequence if and only if $S_{n-1}-a_{n}=2^{[n / 2]}-3$ is representable.\n\nProof. Denote $c=S_{n-1}-a_{n}<a_{n}$. If $a_{n}$ satisfies the required condition, then it is the sum of some subset of $\\left\\{a_{0}, a_{1}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$; then $c$ is the sum of the complement. Conversely, if $c$ is representable, then its representation consists only of the numbers from $\\left\\{a_{0}, \\ldots, a_{n-1}\\right\\}$, so $a_{n}$ is the sum of the complement.\n\nBy Claim 2, in order to prove the problem statement, it suffices to find infinitely many representable numbers of the form $2^{t}-3$, as well as infinitely many non-representable ones. Claim 3. For every $t \\geqslant 3$, we have $2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3$, and $2^{4 t-6}-3>2^{t}-3$.\n\nProof. The inequality follows from $t \\geqslant 3$. In order to prove the equivalence, we apply Claim 1 twice in the following manner.\n\nFirst, since $S_{2 t-3}-a_{2 t-2}=2^{t-1}-3<2^{t}-3<2^{2 t-2}+2^{t-1}=a_{2 t-2}$, by Claim 1 we have $2^{t}-3 \\sim S_{2 t-3}-\\left(2^{t}-3\\right)=2^{2 t-2}$.\n\nSecond, since $S_{4 t-7}-a_{4 t-6}=2^{2 t-3}-3<2^{2 t-2}<2^{4 t-6}+2^{2 t-3}=a_{4 t-6}$, by Claim 1 we have $2^{2 t-2} \\sim S_{4 t-7}-2^{2 t-2}=2^{4 t-6}-3$.\n\nTherefore, $2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{2 t-2} \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3$, as required.\n\nNow it is easy to find the required numbers. Indeed, the number $2^{3}-3=5=a_{0}+a_{1}$ is representable, so Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of representable numbers\n\n$$\n2^{3}-3 \\sim 2^{6}-3 \\sim 2^{18}-3 \\sim \\cdots \\sim 2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \\sim \\cdots .\n$$\n\nOn the other hand, the number $2^{7}-3=125$ is non-representable (since by Claim 1 we have $125 \\sim S_{6}-125=24 \\sim S_{4}-24=17 \\sim S_{3}-17=4$ which is clearly non-representable). So Claim 3 provides an infinite sequence of non-representable numbers\n\n$$\n2^{7}-3 \\sim 2^{22}-3 \\sim 2^{82}-3 \\sim \\cdots \\sim 2^{t}-3 \\sim 2^{4 t-6}-3 \\sim \\cdots\n$$"
